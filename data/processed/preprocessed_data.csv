TPII,$TPII energy co-generation and eCell," triad pro innovators tpii is a leader in distributed energy generation which is an energy production technique that employs smallscale technologies eg solar panels wind or other generators to produce greener or renewable electricity onsite triad pros smallscale localized distributed generators provide lower cost electricity and higher power reliability compared to their outdated counterparts

their generators drive small power plants to provide energy onsite with little reliance on the distribution and transmission grid larger centralized power plants often run on coal oil or nuclear power and are frequently located far from the end users this means longer transmission distances greenhouse gas emissions production of nuclear waste and serious potential for power loss through transporting energy over long distances

triad pro innovators in its energy production division owns and operates distributed combined heat and power chp energy projects that are fueled by cleanburning natural gas these units are located onsite at customers facilities and they produce electricity as well as heat andor chilled water under longterm multiyear contracts cogeneration makes two or three uses of a single burn of clean fuel lowering emissions and increasing efficiency far beyond traditional power plants

here is one fully developed practical example  httpstriadproinccomspree

ARCO,Arcos Dorados $ARCO Owns 2200 McDonald's restaurants in 20 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The cheapest stock I have ever seen.,"a few weeks ago i did some dd on huttig hbp the stock doubled and within a week it received a buyout offer it was an incredibly undervalued company and it was only a matter of time before the market noticed

today i bring you another incredibly undervalued company

arcos dorados holdings arco is basically mcdonalds in latin america and the caribbean they own operate and subfranchise all mcdonalds restaurants over  in all of latin america and the caribbean 

this is a billion dollar company and it is trading like a penny stock at only  sales last year were almost  billion and the company earned  million in net income ebitda was almost  million 

for those who might not know arcos dorados translates to golden arches in spanish

quote directly from the arcos dorados arco investor relations pagehttpswwwarcosdoradoscomircompanyoverview 

gtarcos dorados is the worlds largest independent mcdonalds franchisee operating the largest quick service restaurant chain in latin america and the caribbean it has the exclusive right to own operate and grant franchises of mcdonalds restaurants in  latin american and caribbean countries and territories with more than  restaurants operated by the company or by its subfranchisees that together employ over  thousand people

coronavirus has negatively impacted sales for the last two quarters but the sales trends are improving and the stock is still down massively from where it was before the crisis there is a ton of room for this stock to run higher

the catalyst the outbreak in brazil and other latam countries is slowing considerably these economies are starting to reopen people are starting to line up for big macs and cheeseburgers during the last conference call the company mentioned huge improvement in traffic and sales trends another very important point is that the fast food industry in latin america is highly fragmented with many mom and pop restaurants these restaurants were powerfucked by pandemic related lockdowns and most of them will never reopen arcos dorados will gobble up all this business and consolidate their hold on the latin american and caribbean market long term the pandemic probably is a major boost for the company 

the play the stock trades at only at  these shares are on heavy discount i think the stock should be trading considerably higher and the average yahoo analyst estimate is  the september options  strike are trading at only  cents and the iv for the september calls is under  so you are not overpaying for volatility i think the calls and the shares will increase in value considerably but still for safety i always recommend sticking with common shares when dealing with a penny stock

disclaimer im not pumping this stock but i can clearly see huge value i own  shares which is a small portion of my portfolio do your own due diligence remember the name of the game is to make money if the stock shoots to  remember to bank some profits because nothing is ever  certain but this company is pretty solid its a massive operation with over  restaurants it is not like some biotech company with  employees or a speculative mining play its freaking the latin american mcdonalds corporation",Research,1598348224

minerva neurosciences nerv failed their phase  trial for their schizophrenia drug roluperidone but are repealing the decision due to how the covid has made an impact on their phase  trial all the way up to their phase  trial it has been statistically significant from placebos they are also planning to shrink the amount of testing sites one can only assume because the standard deviations between statistical significance in certain areas was off well significantly one can only assume that one of two things happen here some testing sites have monetary incentive to insure this product doesnt make it to the market or covid was to fault here either way minerva neurosciences has wised up to the idea that these could be possibilities and are narrowing how many hands are in the pot if given the secknd round of phase  trials

BSGM,$BSGM DD Covid Play August 4th,"  

bsgm is releasing phase  data august th at pm on their drug combined with remdisivir

preclinical study  
 

we previously reported that the impdh inhibitor merimepodib mmpd provides a dosedependent suppression of sarscov replication in vitro here we report that a hour pretreatment of vero cells with m mmpd reduces the infectious titer of sarscov more effectively than rem at the same concentration additionally pretreatment of vero cells with both rem and mmpd in combination reduces the infectious titer of sarscov to values below the detectable limit of our tcid assay this result was achieved with concentrations as small as  m mmpd and  m rem at concentrations of each agent as low as  m significant reduction of viral production occurred this study provides evidence that rem and mmpd administered in combination might be an effective treatment for covid cases

httpsfresearchcomarticleshttpsfresearchcomarticles

this drug has been used on zika and many other viruses mmpd has been paired with ribavirin and its effects are stronger when both are combined

httpspubmedncbinlmnihgovhttpspubmedncbinlmnihgov

furthermore mmpd reduces the virus production of zikv as well as several other important emerging viral pathogens such as ebola lassa chikungunya and junin viruses the inhibition can be reversed by addition of exogenous guanosine to culture media consistent with the mechanism of action of mmpd as an impdh inhibitor we also provide evidence that mmpd can be used in combination with other antivirals such as ribavirin and t favipiravir to enhance suppression of virus production

antiviral clinical trial underway for new covid treatment

at st davids south austin medical center some patients are being enrolled into a study for a new antiviral drug called merimepodib

it was also shown to enhance the activity of another antiviral called remdesivir which is presently the standard of care from an antiviral standpoint with regard to treating patients with this dr robinson said and so this study is designed to evaluate this in humans and determine whether this is actually an effective therapy and is beneficial to patients that are suffering from covid

while its not being used to fight other illnesses dr robinson said he feels it is safe as it has been studied enough

there is a fair amount of human data with regard to this medication because it has been investigated in other viral infections and so you know the preponderance of the data suggests that it is a safe medication to administer so far my anecdotal experiences would include the same dr robinson said

keep in mind phase  trials are designed to evaluate the drugs effectiveness in people with the disease or condition being studied and to determine the common shortterm adverse effects and risks associated with the drug

HUGE,"BGFV DD, HUGE short term potential","just some dd that i thought you might all appreciate 

bgfv a no brainer to run up  to  short term

bgfv is a west coast sporting goods retailer that is benefiting from both a revamp of the business and the covid pandemic on the covid side gyms are closed and people are concerned about their health which is driving business for sporting goods nls ran from under  dollars a share to over  on this phenomenon at the same time theaters bars and restaurants are closed so what do people do they hike they canoe and they engage in other outdoor activities

at the same time they have been revamping their business strategy to be opportunistic buyers of merchandise think the tj maxx approach to sporting goods where customers get exceptional value rather than paying top dollar this has led to improved margins in the business and as of last quarter exploding profits 

bgfvs q was just announced with the company earning a whopping  cents a share against a  dollar stock price normalized to remove one time gains the earnings were  cents a share on top of that they provided absolute blowout guidance for q and expect earnings next quarter to be between  dollar and  per share sales in july are already up  over last year on top of that the company reinstated their dividend of  cents a quarter retroactive to q so holders will also get a dividend of  cents a share

the company is also now debt free with  million dollars in cash as of the end of q in june the company had  million in cash and  million in debt that means in a mere month they have generated  million dollars in cash the entire value of the company today about  million

there are really  ways to win here first there is the possibility of the company getting remotely close to the valuation of other sporting good companies spwh for example has similar revenue numbers modest debt and is trading for  times the valuation of bgfv if bgfv were to be valued at the same level of this similar business the price would be in the ballpark of  dollars per share

the second way to win is the inevitable short squeeze on these huge numbers there are over  million shares short as of the last reporting date institutions own almost half the shares insiders own another  that means all but about  million shares are in strong hands and half of the remaining shares are short against a company trading for th of its peers with an absolute blockbuster q on deck and generating cash hand over fist

GNCA,A thorough DD on $GNCA,"what is gnca
   genoceas mission is to help conquer cancer through targeted vaccines and immunotherapies
   using their revolutionary atlas platformhttpswwwgenoceacom to identify true t cell antigens they are creating new lifelines for cancer patients by listening to and learning from the immune system


what is the atlas platform
   in essence this platform developed amp used by gnca is meant for tcell revolution
   in the past several years new therapies like immune checkpoint inhibitors ici and adoptive cell therapies like chimeric antigen receptors carts have offered new hope to millions of people suffering from cancer
   ici therapies take the brakes off t cells a form of white blood cell that can kill tumors by taking the brakes off these drugs help overcome natural barriers erected by cancers to prevent our own immune system and in particular our t cells from fighting cancer
   these new therapies herald future therapies employing t cells to attack tumors with ever greater accuracy
   genocea uses a patients own t cell immune response machinery to identify optimal antigens they can thereby develop a perpatient tumorspecific immune response profile they use this profile to identify truly relevant antigens for each patient
  their atlas technology platform works as follows
    the atlas platform works by having polypeptides corresponding to each identified mutation from a patients tumor are delivered individually into their antigen presenting cells apcs which then process and present the peptides on the cells surface where they can be recognized by t cells if a t cell recognizes and binds to the peptide a cytokine response will be triggered which we measure to determine whether the candidate is a true antigen eliciting a stimulatory immune response or an inhibigen driving inhibitory t cell responses


what is their main pipeline
   their main pipelinehttpswwwgenoceacompipeline is lead cancer vaccine candidate gen
   their other pipelines are 
    gen
    gen


what is gen
   it is known as their neoantigen cancer vaccine program
   neoantigens are personalized tumor mutations that are seen as foreign by an individuals immune system a personalized vaccine therefore targets these neoantigens educating the immune system to find and kill the tumor
   gen is a personalized cancer vaccine that uses our proprietary atlas platform to optimize target selection by selecting neoantigens and excluding inhibigens so that the vaccine has the best chance of targeting the right tumor mutations in each person 
   once they identify the best neoantigens for a patient a personalized vaccine composed of synthetic long peptides paired with the adjuvant polyiclc is formulated and shipped to the clinical site by including empirically confirmed neoantigens to which patients have preexisting responses we create personalized cancer vaccines to which patients immune systems are already primed


gen clinical trial status
   they are currently evaluating the safety immunogenicity and efficacy of gen in a phase a clinical trial gen that consists of two parts
     part a a study of the safety and immunogenicity of gen as monotherapy in certain solid tumor cancer patients with no evidence of disease patient enrollment in this part of the study is complete
    part b a study of the safety immunogenicity and preliminary antitumor activity of gen in adult patients with cutaneous melanoma nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck scchn urothelial carcinoma or renal cell carcinoma


what is gen
   it is a neoantigen adoptive tcell therapy program 
   act or adoptive t cell therapy involves the isolation and expansion of tumor or neoantigenspecific t cells to create therapeutics targeting patients cancers
   in their gen program they are using atlas to identify patientspecific neoantigens that stimulate that patients immune system and exclude inhibigens and then isolating the t cells that are activated by those neoantigens 
   they believe their firstinclass gen approach could provide a number of advantages over existing methodologies such as til tumor infiltrating lymphocyte therapy or tcr t cell receptor therapy

risksnegatives of the business
   as stated on their qks
    a pandemic epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease such as the novel coronavirus or covid has and may in the future adversely affect our business
    we cannot be certain that we will be successful in advancing gen or gen through clinical development obtaining regulatory approval for either product candidate or commercializing either product candidate or any of our future product candidates
    we are substantially dependent on the success of the clinical development of gen our only product candidate currently in active clinical trials any failure to successfully develop or commercialize the gen vaccine or any significant delays in doing so will have a material adverse effect on our business result of operations and financial condition
    because our active product candidate is in an early stage of clinical development there is a high risk of failure and we may never succeed in developing marketable products or generating product revenue
    if we do not obtain regulatory approval for our current and future product candidates our business will be adversely affected
    if we fail to obtain regulatory approval in jurisdictions outside the united states we will not be able to market our products in those jurisdictions
    we may not be successful in establishing and maintaining strategic partnerships which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products
    if we are unable to obtain or protect intellectual property rights related to our product candidates we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets
    our future commercial success depends upon attaining significant market acceptance of our product candidates if approved among physicians patients thirdparty payors and others in the medical community
   if we are unable to establish sales marketing and distribution capabilities we may not be successful in commercializing our product candidates if and when they are approved

    the findings build on previous research presented at sitc  which demonstrated that the presence of an inhibigen in an otherwise protective immunotherapy can completely reverse antitumor responses

AYTU,Load up on AYTU before 🚀 🚀 🌝 (DD included),"before you read


	you can scroll down to the skip here line if you already know the history of aytu

	this is my second dd ever so please give any type of constructive criticism on how i can improve these

	i personally believe aytu is a mid to longterm hold

	as always do your own dd

	this is not a meme stock do your due diligence and actually learn how much potential this stock has instead of shitting on it because you lost money




what is aytu bioscience aytu

	aytu bioscience is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel therapeutics to improve the health of patients addressing significant medical needs such as hypogonadism low testosterone cough and upper respiratory symptoms insomnia male infertility and various paediatric conditions 


why is aytu relavent right now

	president donald trump was criticized for floating the idea of using ultraviolet light and injections of disinfectants to kill covid in humans aytu apparently took the presidents musings to heart and has signed an agreement with privatelyheld sterling medical devices to help commercialize a lightbased therapy to treat covid the device is called healight sourcehttpsfinanceyahoocomnewspresidenttrumpaskedlightinsidehtml


	aytu recently acquired exclusive us distribution rights to the covid rapid test this test can detect covid in under  minutes sourcehttpsfinanceyahoocomnewsaytubioscienceannounceschinaexporthtml

	aytu recently acquired innovus pharmaceuticals a specialty pharmaceutical company commercializing licensing and developing safe and effective consumer healthcare products designed to improve mens and womens health and vitality innovus commercializes over thirtyfive consumer health products competing in large healthcare categories including diabetes mens health sexual wellness and respiratory health sourcehttpsaytubiocom


aytus products

fda approved

	natesto the only fdaapproved nasal formulation of testosterone for men with hypogonadism low testosterone
	zolpimist the only fdaapproved oral spray prescription sleep aid
	tuzistra xr the only fdaapproved hour codeinebased antitussive syrup 


other

	karbinal er an extendedrelease carbinoxamine antihistamine suspension indicated to treat numerous allergic conditions
	polyviflor and triviflor two complementary prescription fluoridebased supplement product lines containing combinations of fluoride and vitamins in various for infants and children with fluoride deficiency


skip to here




alright here we go now that you have some idea of what aytu is lets look at some financials data technical analysis news and my thoughts

financials amp data

	over the last  quarters aytu has seen an astronomical increase in revenue last years quarter on  they recorded total revenue of  on  it drastically increased to  cash on hand went up  from december to march last  quarters it has beat earnings by a margin it is also expected to beat earnings this upcoming quarter on  their total cash went from  reported on  quarter to  for last quarter on  aytus average volume is at  million which is good but it can definitely be higher once healight gets approved there are m shares of aytu  held by insiders and  held by institutions market cap as of today is at  million dollars i definitely believe all these numbers will be even higher for this quarter


technical analysis

	looking at the  day time frame aytu everything about the chart is bullish macd has just done the golden cross which is a sign that this stock is going up for the last  months aytu has usually been between  and  it had  spikes up to  between april and may and that was because of er healight and the addition to russel  in the last week aytu went from  to  volume has also significantly increased in the last month people are doing real dd on this stock and noticing how much potential it actually has compared to redditors calling it a meme stock

some things to consider


	every bag holder of aytu is waiting for fda approval of healight if healight can curetreat covid this stock will  to the  

	bag holders are also looking forward to earnings because i can totally see it above  once its near because of how much money they are making with the rapid test kits

	please dont listen to the shittalkers of this stock theyre just mad because they lost money on it they are definitely rookies and dont know how to hold they also definitely didnt do any dd on it and dont know how much potential it has

	it has been recently upgraded to a zacks rank  strong buy this upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices

	it has a price target of 

	through all this we have seen over m shares being bought by the aytu board of directors just in  which states that the future of aytu is in good hands because the board believes in it proofgt httpsimgurcomaabrxeh

	i believe right now is the perfect time to buy aytu its been holding strong over a dollar for months and once the q report is in i personally expect it to be over  easily


my positions

	 shares at  will be adding another  if it dips under 



overall aytu bioscience is a strong buy for me everything is financially positive for this stock numbers dont lie they are working on a possible uv light treatment for covid called healight they have over  rapid test kits for covid its a strong buy from all the elite analysts it has a price target between  lastly again stop listening to the shittalkers who call this a meme stock because they didnt do any dd they definitely lost money and they just like to be trend hoppers and say what others say

reverse stock in april is history and wont see another public offering finished early last month and raised mil these two things drove the price down now theres no where to go but up they have the funds to increase inventory to support the amazon sales expansion in mexico and so on with hand tools and power tools coming q  theyre finally moving forward and will continue a steady incline of  centsweek thats at least  by end of next month under  buy in for toughbuilt is pretty solid if youre ok with waiting a few months to double up janfeb  july th  this will not be under  imho 

 

i know some folks bought into tblt at the wrong time but i believe the  stock has hit its bottom the expansion into mexico and other markets in latin america will bring additional steady revenue for tblt amazon sales continue to be strong in the domestic market if the company would provide additional guidance as to efforts to increase their presence in other outlets like they did with lowes in the past that would certainly provide additional confidence to stock buyers

CREX,$CREX - Some DD,"disclaimers i bought  shares yesterday and the company i work for is one of their customers

this company makes a product called thermal mirror its essentially a self check temp for businesses its a android tablet that tells you your temperature

it has face recognition of employees so it can send an alert to hr if an employee has too high of a temp it also can tell if someone is wearing a mask and deny entry all of these features can be turned on or off

soon they should add label printing so it can print out a label if someone passes

also judging by the attachments i wouldnt be surprised if in the future if it integrates into building security or a rfid time clock system

point of all this is they have a product that should be very versatile even after covid is done

in addition a partnership with samsung was announced yesterday where samsungs manufacturing will be using it

i really think this would be a good  month swing trade",Discussion,1595077371

may th tweet they start to add a test kit for covid
we understand the link between covid and sepsis we are adding a sarscov molecular test to our tdx platform at the end of june we aim to offer the tsarscov panel enabling clinicians to id covid infections and secondary infections that can lead to sepsis

june th adding  well reputable individuals to their board of directors
we are thrilled to add to our board three new individuals including thierry bernard ceo qiagen dr ninfa saunders president and ceo navicent health and robin toft founder and ceo toft group

june th announces the us launch of the test which will help detect the virus responsible for covid
we are proud to announce the us launch of our new molecular diagnostic test the tsarscov panel which has demonstrated excellent clinical performance in the detection of sarscov the virus responsible for covid bitlyyljpmd

july nd its in stock ready to ship and the panel is validated in accordance with the eua requirement from the fda they submitted an eua request to the fda
detect covid with confidence using the tsarscov panel which enables direct detection of sarscov from upper respiratory samples  the panel has been validated in accordance with emergency use authorization requirements from the fda 

so now all were waiting for is the fda approval which is very likely coming in the near future id say before or around august and this stock will jump like any other stock that has shot up after an fda approval 

the only difference youre going to be in it before the jump as always do your dd fact check every information as you like and only invest what you can afford to lose

last week the company announced a partnership with the american video game league the two will launch autumn anarchy a firstofitskind college esports tournament this will include more than  gamers nationwide to compete in qualifying tournaments it will be triple a popular gaming titles and the winners will receive  in scholarship prize money and gain entry into code red one of the largest influencers in esports events in the industry

insiders possess  of the companys total shares with institutions holding  of that

the company is estimating its revenue growth to increase by  in the current quarter upcoming 

beginning early august and into early september they will move digital and instore media channels and make them serve as the exclusive access point for student gamers to sign up for the aaa title tournaments via a dedicated email or qr code sign featured at the front of the entrance with more than a hundred and fifty participating college campuses


looking further i know that float is  million and the peg ratio is currently at  and the current price level is  off its sma and  from its day simple moving average the rsi is pointing at  why the volatility over the past week is  and drops to a little under  over the past one month the beta value is  price target for the stock is  with highs ranging to 

cash on hand is  million dollars with operating cash flow of  million gross revenue  billion gross profit  million 

it is rated as a buy from two different analystsanalyst dont mean much but a great sign

it is estimated that  of college kids play video games and this will be launching initially at  different colleges this will be a massive hit with payout to tournaments being scholarships the advertising portion to make revenuecheck added info at bottom will be massive as well while i do not think they will lead the way i think they will take their fair chunk of market and revenue 

the last couple weeks it has exploded and is up  on the month and  friday alone with so much left to go with august approaching very quickly i believe that it will hit  within the next two weeks 

this is a side venture of a very reputable company and i believe they are moving in the right direction and very quickly they wont be here long as news is making its way across the trading circles and was really catching on friday  i believe  is the cap i would personally feel comfortable entering but that decision is always independent of the investor i just could honestly see this leaving penny land and never returning

added info according to newzoos  global esports market report total esports revenues will reach  billion in  an increase of almost  million compared to the highestgrossing esports revenue stream worldwide is sponsorship which will generate  million in  up from  million in 

just a fraction of that market will be huge

risk factors
   as stated on their recent sec filings
    we have restated our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   and all quarterly periods of  and  which may lead to additional risks and uncertainties including loss of investor confidence and negative impacts on our stock price
    our operations have been impacted by and we may face further business disruption and related risks resulting from the covid pandemic which could have a material adverse effect on our business
    our evaluation and potential pursuit of strategic and financial alternatives may result in significant transaction expenses and could adversely impact our business and our stock price
    our product candidates may cause side effects which could delay or prevent their commercialization
    if we are unable to establish sales marketing and distribution capabilities for our product candidates or any future product candidate that receives regulatory approval we may not be successful in commercializing those product candidates if approved
    our product candidates if approved will face significant competition and our failure to effectively compete may prevent us from achieving significant market penetration
    even if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval the products may become subject to unfavorable thirdparty coverage or reimbursement policies which would harm our business

final thoughtscomments
   as always please make sure you read everything i included in this dd such as the sec filings the corporate presentation etc just to make sure youre knowledgeable on the company before making any purchasing decisions on novn
   anyways as you can see i did not add a quarterly financials portion as this stock is like shll in a sense that theyre not reporting anything at the moment since they do not have a marketable product as of right now
   i love the fact that they do have multiple pipelines in phase  of clinical studies and the fact that they are now entering the covid sphere by conducting studies to possibly make an oral or nasal spray treatment for covid
   granted its at a low price compared to my most recent dds i dont mind buying a few hundred shares in novn especially since the current price is at  and they just recently completed an million direct offering at  a share which is why i cant see this price falling below than that price it was offered at

risksnegative side of the business
   as stated on their recent sec filings
    global health crises and pandemics such as the global outbreak of the novel coronavirus covid may adversely impact our business
    we are dependent on the commercial success of hetlioz and fanapt
    growth of hetlioz and fanapt may be slow or limited for a variety of reasons including competing products or unanticipated safety issues if either hetlioz or fanapt is not successful in gaining broad commercial acceptance our business would be harmed
    if the fda does not accept for filing the ndas that we may submit for tradipitant for the treatment of atopic dermatitis the treatment of gastroparesis and the treatment of motion sickness or the fda determines that our clinical trial results for tradipitant for the treatment of atopic dermatitis the treatment of gastroparesis or the treatment of motion sickness do not demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy or the fda does not approve an applicable pdufavi date continued development of tradipitant will be significantly delayed or terminated our business will be significantly harmed and the market price of our stock could decline
    even after we obtain regulatory approvals of a product acceptance of the product in the marketplace is uncertain and failure to achieve commercial acceptance will prevent or delay our ability to generate significant revenue from such product
    disruptions to our hetlioz or fanapt supply chains could materially affect our level of success in commercializing hetlioz or fanapt thereby reducing our future earnings and prospects
    we intend to seek regulatory approvals for our products in additional foreign jurisdictions but we may not obtain any such approvals
    we rely on a limited number of specialty pharmacies for distribution of hetlioz in the us and the loss of one or more of these specialty pharmacies or their failure to distribute hetlioz effectively would materially harm our business

ASNA,Thoughts on ASNA and bankruptcy?," i got out of them around  with the last of what i had bought  swung it quite a few times for a nice overall profit

its down to  and bloomberg keeps putting out unconfirmed bankruptcy articles  they did approve retention bonuses for the ceos recently which is never a good sign but now the share price is getting quite low especially considering the previous reverse split 

normally i would not consider trading in companies headed for bankruptcy but it seems the trend this year is to send bankrupt stocks soaring  since there isnt a huge float due to the previous reverse split it seems like this stock could make major moves with some attention

the reports about them closing stores are from bloomberg and there has been nothing from the company or official sources  asna is notoriously close mouthed and i doubt well hear anything until it actually happens  

this company has quite a few good brands but terrible management with zero pr and do not seem to have transitioned enough to online sales  it is not a company i want to invest in anymore but rhers seem to buy anything thats going bankrupt so why not consider this one  thoughts",Discussion,1594382188

EVFM,DD (sorta) for EVFM Phexxi,"for the sake of transparency this is the first time ive typed up dd on something everything here is just information ive come across from when i first put this stock on my watchlist in may to now the information below is more about the product than the company although i encourage you to look into them further as this isnt the only thing theyre working on



on may  of  evfm received fda approval for a new method of birth control which in my opinion is nothing short of revolutionary compared to whats on the market today you may not know anything about female birth control and thats fine because im about to try and educate your ass 

what is the product why does it matter

the birth control product is called phexxi its a nonhormonal gel that can be applied an hour or less before sex to prevent pregnancy and thats it there are a couple of reasons this is a big deal

 all existing female birth control methods the pill the shot the implant the iud etc are long term options if you miss a pill its inconvenient if you miss two good luck figuring out whether or not its even effective at that point the shot and the implant must be maintained over a certain period of time  months or  years respectively and a lot of women have issues with iuds due to painful side effects and other reasons the last one is particularly important spermicides exist of course but they have a failure rating of over 

 other than sticking a sponge or a silicone cup up there women only have two options for nonhormonal birth control one is sterilization which isnt widely preferable for obvious reasons and the other is the copper iud which is known for painful side effects such as intense cramping and bleeding this is an issue because many women cant take hormonal birth control either because theyre breastfeeding want to avoid hormonal sideeffects such as weight gain or they simply have a body chemistry that doesnt allow for extra hormones in their system this also goes for people who have survived cancer of the uterus or similar issues its also important to note that any hormonal birth control you take has a high chance of just fucking up your dayyear for example its pretty common for people to get the shot or the implant only to bleed constantly for up to a year and this is considered normal 

the product that evfm is putting out is a solution to both of these problems that effect a significant percentage of the female population simply put this is the only method to exist where a woman can use it and then not worry about it theres true beauty in simplicity 

when is the catalyst

the product is hitting the market sometime in early september according to a shareholder letterhttpsevofeminvestorroomcomevofembiosciencesissuesmidyearlettertostockholders i recommend reading it released by the ceo of evfm on  however also mentioned in the letter is a coming soon campaign or a hype campaign around phexxi for both doctors and consumers there will also be a telemedicine support system released thats supposed to make getting the drug easier for consumers who need nonhormonal options it was also stated that evfm is trying to get phexxi covered under the aca making it widely available to those who need it 

i know a lot of you arent longterm holders but if youre going to buy i would suggest doing so sooner than later as i mentioned above ive had this stock on my watchlist since may and im kicking myself now for not having bought in sooner when it was in the s midjune 

its important to point out that the ceo  of the executive team and  of the board of directors for evfm are women this matters beyond just supporting a female led company it means that this is a product made for women and put out by women which i believe says something about its potential success



just so you guys know i dont trade with large amounts of money i started my rh account with  dollars thats it and i only own  shares of evfm at  because of that what im saying is im not trying to hype this up for my own gains for me this is more of a hobby than an intense trading game like it is for a lot of you i really do believe that theres money to be made here if youre willing to put the time in for a longer hold or you can wait for it to pop and try to chase it on the way up i wont judge",Research,1594217835

with the new white house executive order soon to be enforced foreign satcom and telecom powers will be eventually removed from the united states its an issue of national security and can almost be seen as a political stride for dominance in the leo satellite data communication industry america likes to win 

ampxb

leading up to today the executives of gsat have been loading up a massive amount of shares at this point in time they now own over  of all the shares and another whopping  are owned by institutions such as blackrock

ampxb

globalstar has an entire fleet of satellites currently in the sky you can watch them in real time here   httpswwwnyocomsatelliteschttpswwwnyocomsatellitesc 

httpswwwaerospacetechnologycomprojectsglobalstarhttpswwwaerospacetechnologycomprojectsglobalstar 

 the satellites are placed in eight orbital planes of six satellites each inclined at  to provide service on earth from  north latitude to  south latitude the globalstar constellation consists of  leo satellites with an additional four satellites in orbit as spares

ampxb

with the new st chip they not only get to take control of the skies they are now able to be incorporated into oem products such as our consumer hardware laptops phones tablets etc one immediate example of this is their partnership with nokia which can take them to the next level as gsat was just approved to purchase their own g band n

and jeep who will be using them in their vehicles for long distance communication this is powerful tech and it is being employed trucking companies and freighters for those reasons

summary

globalstar is a usa based company that provides asset tracking cellular data and voice and more via its own satellite system these are critical in commercial markets such as transportation construction and utilities where items are very expensive or communication is critical but hard to access there is an executive order from the white house to remove all foreign adversary telecom equipment from our utilities and power grid due to risk of cyber attacks this puts globalstar in a great position as they recently pushed out their new st product and bought g spectrum band n to be used in utilities applications which they showed off at a conference this month with nokia they are partnered with jeep and have an upcoming earnings report for q insiders own  of shares and have been loading up according to sec filings the future seems very bright for this one and im hoping we caught it early possible medium term play too if you want hold

video on ayro if your interested  httpstwittercomayroincstatusshttpstwittercomayroincstatuss 

some of these are old news but the reason why they havent moved yet was because literally no one saw it the volume of ayro was barely holding k just recently weve been getting mil volume in fact on thursday there was a  mil volume day

ampxb

great ayro chart 

rsi is picking up heat but it still needs fuel rsi is at  which means its at a good deal and it doesnt look like there will be a dip anytime soon 

macd is crossing over last time it did this ayro went from  to  

squeeze breakout this stock was having trouble climbing past that  zone and now that its past that point its going to rocket 

volume picking up just like gnus ship tops etc this volume came out of nowhere and could continue to go higher if theres more fuel to the rocket 

strong solid company brand new and there having a pr soon too 

ampxb

shit sidecons on ayro

this is a really micro stock the market cap is literally in the millions on top of this we dont know if ev stocks are going to cool off this week this is really important in my opinion but the thing is if people notice that ayro is an ev stock and notice it hasnt bounced yet fomo will hit them like a truck because they wouldnt want to miss the next shll wkhs etc driving the price up 

ampxb

another con about this company is the fact that they merged with the notorious dcar yes the shitty company if im right about this there are lots of shortsasks on dcar if thats how it works meaning that there might be a resistancewall we would have to break in order for this thing to rocket

ampxb

there is some resistance at the  mark because of dcar the ma  is at  while the  ma is at the  mark but then again it has completely obliterated the  and  ma before when there was no volume plus using other indicators rsimacd it looks like we will absolutely destroy the  mark

ampxb

why fomo might cause this to rocket

everyone wants to get a piece of the ev stock hype just look at  
wkhs  
solo  
tsla  
shll  
nkla  


all literally went up  yet ayro has barely moved and by this logic people are going to see this and think hmm i can get in early as hell because of how hot ev stocks are now maybe i should get in and once it ayro pumps a bit and goes up up up up people will literally fomo the fuck out of this stock just like nkla and wkhs 

ampxb

on stocktwits ayro went from having around a few hundred watchers to  on thursday to over  today people are just noticing this stock which is insane 

ampxb

tldr

 to the mooon 

jokes aside this is a really solid play in my opinion it has really low float great ceo low market cap more revenue than wkhs and ev stocks are so hot right now 

chart wise the rsi is curling up really bullish and has a  meaning its a great deal macd is curling very bullish squeeze through and starting to push off the resistance  ma already volume picking up so much etc

ampxb

solid solid news pr soon i believe x facility merge with dcar 

this price target of this stock is limitless it can literally go to  and could be the next wkhsnkla if it gets hyped enough and we get more and more buyers overall im bullish

they very recently expanded their electric vehicle manufacturing facility

ampxb

most if not all ev related stocks have completely went parabolic including  
nkla   
tsla  
shll  
wkhs  
solo

ampxb

they have one of the lowest floats  httpslowfloatreportcomhttpslowfloatreportcom 

volume is starting to really pump and people are actually just starting to spread tweet post reddit stuff about this etc just yesterday there was nearly  million volume 

looking like the same exact pattern where ayro went from  to  with only a fraction of the volume it has now

video on ayro if your interested  httpstwittercomayroincstatusshttpstwittercomayroincstatuss 

some of these are old news but the reason why they havent moved yet was because literally no one saw it the volume of ayro was barely holding k just recently weve been getting mil volume in fact on thursday there was a  mil volume day

ampxb

great ayro chart 

rsi is picking up heat but it still needs fuel rsi is at  which means its at a good deal and it doesnt look like there will be a dip anytime soon 

macd is crossing over last time it did this ayro went from  to  

squeeze breakout this stock was having trouble climbing past that  zone and now that its past that point its going to rocket 

volume picking up just like gnus ship tops etc this volume came out of nowhere and could continue to go higher if theres more fuel to the rocket 

strong solid company brand new and there having a pr soon too 

ampxb

shit sidecons on ayro

this is a really micro stock the market cap is literally in the millions on top of this we dont know if ev stocks are going to cool off this week this is really important in my opinion but the thing is if people notice that ayro is an ev stock and notice it hasnt bounced yet fomo will hit them like a truck because they wouldnt want to miss the next shll wkhs etc driving the price up 

ampxb

another con about this company is the fact that they merged with the notorious dcar yes the shitty company if im right about this there are lots of shortsasks on dcar if thats how it works meaning that there might be a resistancewall we would have to break in order for this thing to rocket

ampxb

there is some resistance at the  mark because of dcar the ma  is at  while the  ma is at the  mark but then again it has completely obliterated the  and  ma before when there was no volume plus using other indicators rsimacd it looks like we will absolutely destroy the  mark

ampxb

why fomo might cause this to rocket

everyone wants to get a piece of the ev stock hype just look at  
wkhs  
solo  
tsla  
shll  
nkla  


all literally went up  yet ayro has barely moved and by this logic people are going to see this and think hmm i can get in early as hell because of how hot ev stocks are now maybe i should get in and once it ayro pumps a bit and goes up up up up people will literally fomo the fuck out of this stock just like nkla and wkhs 

ampxb

on stocktwits ayro went from having around a few hundred watchers to  on thursday to over  today people are just noticing this stock which is insane 

ampxb

tldr

 to the mooon 

jokes aside this is a really solid play in my opinion it has really low float great ceo low market cap more revenue than wkhs and ev stocks are so hot right now 

chart wise the rsi is curling up really bullish and has a  meaning its a great deal macd is curling very bullish squeeze through and starting to push off the resistance  ma already volume picking up so much etc

ampxb

solid solid news pr soon i believe x facility merge with dcar 

this price target of this stock is limitless it can literally go to  and could be the next wkhsnkla if it gets hyped enough and we get more and more buyers overall im bullish

ceo rodney varner confirms aldevron and genprex relationship dating back to 

gnpx was trading at  before it was fda fast tracked in jan  that plus the following catalyst sent it all the way to  it has since dropped to the  area i personally think this thing could be huge in the next  years or even sooner

this year they have done  offerings for approx  million combined to fund these trials if the trials are unsuccessfully this would setback genprex heavily


upon further research

the aldevron partnership will provide for production of tusc plasmid dna the active agent in oncoprex at full commercial scale also keep in mind aldevron is building a acre gene therapy campus that will expand its manufacturing capacity by x they will begin construction on this campus in august  they plan to have it completed by q  

also i was able to find that the fda fast track for gpx in jan  is expected by genprex to be fully approved by the beginning of  this aligns with the time frame aldevron intends to finish the acre gene therapy campus coincidence maybe 

but upon further research i was able to find an interviewhttpswwwgooglecomampswwwproactiveinvestorscomcompaniesampnews with the ceo rodney varner and in this interview he confirm that genprex and aldevron have been working together to manufacture tusc since  

they have been working on this for the past  years with one of the top cancer research institutes ut md anderson and are now fda fast tracked this very same technology is what they are planning to do with alpha cells in the pancreas to cure diabetes with the university of pittsburgh

also they are expecting to begin human trials on gpx fda fast track mid  we should expect an update anytime from now until august i would believe 

also took a look at a few of the guys involved

SOLO,"So here are my thoughts on SOLO so far, in case anyone isn't clued in, SOLO is Electromeccanica","this is just meant to eb a seed discussion since i obviously dont have the whole picture at all

what i do see in solo first to get it out of the way a terrible name electromechacanopiascopy might as well been the same for as catchy as itd ever be that could be a disadvantage

musk snared the name tesla at a time when the works of nikola tesla were becoming more and more honored and recognized but now when you look up tesla you have upsetting feelings 

regardless ev and then even av are considered stepping stones into the future if musk has it his way wed live in a final fantasy  type world of extreme class stratification where the working class only has relics were left with to get by on 

there was this question from someone i wont quote because it might change the context of this but heres how it goes if you can invent something that would be the leading killer of healthy adults not to mention horrible injuries full disclosure my parents will killed in a car wreck and im sure we all know someone it would destroy the planet have cascading effects across the political spectrum leading to collusion agianst everyones interests and its mere existence seeks to preclude any other alternative would you agree that its a good invention

you have its a car the main life form in the us where more space is dedicated to cars than people with the exception of corporate persons 

before covid car fatalities killing   healthy adults a year seemed impressive

weve somehow been conditioned into identifying with our cars as if they were part of our identities to the point where people who are going through a mid life crisis is synonymous with buying a race car this entails the ridiculous act of pedaling an average  ton piece of metal to transport one person around not to mention your car is essentially a gigantic id card you drag around wherever you go and police do passively scan license plates

tesla among other nefarious acts of corporate whoredom intends to destroy public transport and privatize it beyond the reaches of those who need a means to get them and their kids to work while planes are arguably just as bad albeit safer

solo falls into the same category as tesla although theyre going for more of a vw bug approach by making essentially the anti tesla this i actually do support as things are the way they are now and it seems like musk will continue to deny us levitating trains for as long as he can just like he killed the high speed rail project by siphoning bn tax payer dollars out of the common transportation grant pool

solo doesnt technically make cars they found a way to make something that works like a single passenger car with plenty of store space that falls within the category of a motorcycle minus the dangers involved and being an ev so its basically an evolved highway legal vespa

this strategy not only keeps production costs down due to the much less rigorous certification but some other stand out advantages in terms of profitability is that as a single passenger car the company can keep pumping out the same thing over and over again and export it anywhere in the world because you dont have to move the steering wheel it is also small light weight and basically just a more reasonable means of transport in terms of person to machine ratio

i see this potentially be a fantastic commuter car but i also see the high likelihood of people using them as delivery fleets asians in particular i suspect will be all about the solo as is much of europe because they dont have so much the car self identity culture we have and theyre used to driving smaller cars without it affecting their masculinity

cars in america are basically like guns but to broader group of people

so the biggest resistance to it i would suspect would be in america

so pros

very fuel efficient

safe

not stupidly over sized

ease of parking

affordable to manufacture and to purchase

great for fleet services

okay for  spontaneous rentals

solo is covid safe 

space left for others

cons

its name is a mouthful 

not so okay for spontaneously rentals since most people want a passenger 

americans in particular think they look weird and the word wussy comes to mind

canadian although they are in the midst of creating a plant here i wish people would aim for regions that need work like ohio f amazon for doing that stupid city dance off and kudos to cuomo and the city council for giving amazon a rude welcome and farewell

people will use them as stunt vehicles for fun which can possibly cause more injuries

we really dont know much about them yet and so lots of questions about their comfort and safety linger 

i do think the ability to out produce tesla and other car companies with more affordable cars is a good solid niche so i personally think this is a good long haul investment

BYFC,"$BYFC Huge Potential With Proven Facts, PR, and Stock Analysis","with blackout tuesday approaching many african american owned banks should see a spike incoming there are a lot of factors that push byfc above the others which i will get into the most important is that byfc is the poster child of what blackout tuesday wants to emphasize

 beginning with the fact that broadway federal bank byfc is minority depository institution meaning that  or more of the voting stock is minority owned a majority of the board of directors is minority and the institution serves predominantly minority owned communities what also puts them over other banks such as carv is that they serve to low income communities in southern california whereas carv is primarily in ny according to forbes there are four majorityminority states in the us which includes california but not ny

 recent pr  in the article linked below robert f smith the countrys richest black person went on to say the following

gtsmiths comments came after circulating a plan among ceos that calls on big banks to capitalize on the financial institutions that cater to blackowned businesses and entrepreneurial ventures smith called the process reparative capital in a keynote address he gave at the forbes  summit on philanthropy last month he pointed out that most black communities have been shunned by large banks and they lack the capital necessary to build businesses and local institutions

mr smith also said  of african american communities dont even have a branch or bank of any type supporting them

byfc is all about pushing minority owned business and helping low income minorities in all of california and eventually the whole southwest

mission statement

the bankss mission is to serve the real estate business and financial needs of customers in undeserved urban communities with a commitment to excellent service profitability and sustained growth

 byfc stock analysis

according to investorsobservers byfc received a rating of  and overall rating of  for those of you who dont understand what this means a rating of  means that it scores higher than  of stocks in the industry a overall rating of  means it is above  all stocks these ratings are a real tool that allows stocks to be compared to each other and byfc stands tall compared to others

competitively byfc is the cheaper per share price when looking at carv or uone this allows more people and multiple types of traders to enter

 lastly there was a huge spike for blackout friday jumped from mid  to

the new partner is providing a broad range of services and solutions in more than  countries in strategy consulting digital technology and operations and is a global leader in applying innovative solutions for improving organizations operations and efficiency

comprised of industry leaders from bb security firms and government agencies as well as elite military units we understand and appreciate the complex challenges of protecting data in the digital transformation

in february of this year mr avi rubinstein a seasoned cybersecurity expert joined us as the companys chief business officer since then we changed our gotomarket strategy from direct to indirect sales this transition has allowed us to successfully partner with many leading channel partners in north and south america asia pacific europe and africa our cloudbased security solutions enable and support the remote work environment that organizations require to successfully and securely ride through these challenging times as well as in the future and we are indeed witnessing an increasing interest in our innovative solutions

safet group ltd nasdaq tase sfet a provider of secure access solutions for onpremise and hybrid cloud environments today announced the launch of its perimeter access orchestration fabric paof designed to take its leading zero trust network access ztna solution to the next level

june   safet announces the launch of new product by netnut data center proxy network

revenue up almost  this year

organizations today face a wide range of remote access scenarios and requirements all of which must be addressed by a single solution such as

 employees and thirdparty contractors accessing internal resources
 internal users connecting via the corporate network accessing internal resources
 remote access to cloudbased and onpremises legacy applications and
 integration of multi factor authentication mfa and identity awareness into all remote access scenarios


on april   the company reported a significant decrease of approximately  in its liabilities of a total of  million pertaining to the convertible debentures issued in april  and in subsequent convertible loan transactions undertaken by the company on april   the company retired in full its outstanding debenture debt including redemption premium and accrued interest zero risk of bankruptcy

summary

revenue is up almost before massive contract from last year and this stock is currently showing a pennant bullish technical chart this company will benefit from a second wave of covid due to the need for corporations that transition to work from home government also just announced their partnership new software perfect timing get in for the moon

further info 

massive reach as a company 

new contracts 

public float  million

no debt

bullish for three months leading up to contracts

the fair value was reported at  a share before these contracts and its massive revenue and now is easily worth  

covid has been going around in china since before december this will continue with no end in sight and more companies will be looking to employ from home with cybersecurity becoming a must necessity 

they have contracts with massive intelligence services and you can assume if an intelligence service would trust the software so would any retail business

they have not released the name of all the clients specifically and pr is in the pipeline i would assume to announce all moves as well as established and new contracts that were acquired by sfet this company has never been in a better financial situation and moving forward they will continue to acquire clients and contracts at a rapid rate 

this is a short and midrange play that i see easily pushing  or more i know some will take profits but i would personally hold until all clients and contracts are made clear as the extent is unknown and could be quite substantial 

although i doubt many of you will hold long term i can definitely see this company from  by eoy

XSPA,Why People Need To Forget About $XSPA (lmbo I'm bullish btw; in since .4082 r/s),"tldr  xspa is a stock with a proven ceo solid business plan and three major airports away from this thing being  it will take off but all unfounded doubt and speculation do is hurt its potential sell if you want to sell hold if you want to hold its that simple anything under  is good anything under  which hopefully we wont see again is gold

i havent been frequenting or following this sub as much as i was between marchmay but i wanted to offer some advice for those of you in xspa

i remember the days when xspa was  cents as a newbie i hopped in and the second it dropped to  cents a few days later i hopped out  careful cautious reckless and green all of these applied to me well just my luck a week or two later was the first time it went  to  that was when xpresscheck was first announced and not long after doug satzman was announced as ceo after which it went to  heres the kicker though and where the title of my post comes in

it was a solid month between it going to  and the launch to  ive seen a lot of people complaining and giving up hope asking when are we going to the moon whats taking so long should i sell and my favorite if i dont see anything by this insert day im selling i get it but heres the thing

ive studied this stocks patterns since i started trading its always been on my radar and tbh i hope the one that helps me hit it big ive been here and made money off of uavs mvis and mark all when they first had their big debuts

if you want to be profitbale wthis stock hyping it up constantly is not the move i know the rs and offering left a bad taste in a lot of peoples mouths but at this point the best thing is to either sell or get in for the long haul and average down i get we all have questions and want to know things but the more speculation and doubt are in the air which decreases its ability to consolidate the less chance we have of flying when the real pr takes off

my average was so low because so so so many gave up hope and honestly hopped out the amount of posts ive read of people who hopped out anywhere from  days before it went to  is unreal but i watched and i wanted and i knew what i prices i wanted for the shares i wanted i waited almost a month this time before i averaged up simply because i didnt want to ruin my average i believe we have strong support at  especially after today and in the long term wairports like chicago miami dallas la etc we see  by end of august but this will be a long hold it always has been",None,1593442230

CLSK,WALMART AND CLSK CONFIRMED TODAY. AND MORE NEWS COMING,"here it is ladies and gentlemen in the fucking flesh not only have we confirmed that the secret customer is walmart but through new series of conversation with cleanspark we are now being hinted at a new catalyst soon could this be a new potential big customer or contract there is likely to be news released this week

ampxb

exhibit a hints towards walmart updated with extra emails

ampxb

httpsimgurcomaulqanhttpsimgurcomaulqanhttpsimgurcomaulqanhttpsimgurcomaulqan

ampxb

exhibit b hints at news release soon a handful of your other fellow redditors have gone out on their own to contact clsk and submitted emails like these to us

ampxb

httpsimgurcomawayhfxrhttpsimgurcomawayhfxrhttpsimgurcomawayhfxrhttpsimgurcomawayhfxr

ampxb

names and contact information are blurred to protect all parties involved from harassment and their personal information

ampxb



ampxb

how do we know its walmart we have obtained all the pieces we need

ampxb

  one of the nations largest retailers with more than  stores in the us from feb  press release 

ampxb

walmart has  stores in the us and they also own sams club and a major auto services chain with over  us locations and other subsidiaries as well

ampxb

  friends in bentonville a huge hint from our email dialogue with investor relations 

ampxb

walmart is headquartered in bentonville arkansas name me one other fucking company from fucking bentonville that fits these descriptions ill give you two bucks

ampxb

 walmart wants to be a leader in the clean energy movement and pledges to make a full scale shift to clean energy sources starting in 

ampxb

walmart statement under these arrangements walmart agrees to buy renewable power from an energy provider over a long period of time  often    or more years longterm ppas have unlocked enormous renewable potential but have also required a new way of thinking

ampxb

 read the newly added sections to the first email chain nasdaq restrictions and nondisclosure agreements have stifled cleansparks ability to publicize who these companies are in largescale public news releases but if you read into how ndas work there are massive loopholes in how you can phrase things especially in oneonone contact they have wanted us to figure it out and we urge you to contact them yourself too if you want to hear the same results

ampxb



ampxb

 this is why their revenue has grown by  yearoveryear q  to q 

ampxb

how was this never priced in but omg op how its old news from feb op 

ampxb

 the same day it was announced feb  was one of the first days of the covid stock market crash the news was completely drowned out and left in the dust look at what happened on the chart

 the secret customer was never publicly revealed to be walmart due to nondisclosure agreements but if you read into how ndas work there are massive loopholes in how you can phrase things especially in oneonone contact

ampxb



ampxb

 oh and by the way lets forget about their government contracts massive military contracts and overseas expansion

 lets also forget that theyre adding huge scaling to their mvos and mpulse software to be implemented into university campuses for microgrid power outage backup systems

 lets also forget that insiders obtained a massive amount of shares on thursday its not like they know something might be happening nah of course not theyre only executives pfft

ampxb

that is all good luck see you in another galaxy soon

 i was also wondering if anyone knows why someone bought m shares   before the bell on friday and how that might effect the stock come monday



part  

additionally during my first  weeks of trading i have learned a lot about picking stocks and dd currently i use a combination of thinkorswims scanner and twitter  reddit to find stocks of interest i then do my own dd into the company and their financials before i invest 

so far i have done a great job other than this last impulse buy back into idex live and learn however i was wondering what you guys do 

ive made my biggest plays on izea bte solo idex ktov

id like to hear other strategies for making picks i started with  and im up to  i realize the stocks ive made money on are not typical as the market has been very bullish the past few weeks 

my goal is to learn how to make more consistent picks properly dd and solidify a standard for myself when it comes to entry and exit strategies

june    pm 
china jojo drugstores nasdaq cjjd disclosed

china jojo drugstores inc a nevada corporation the company makes the following disclosure pursuant to the order the order issued by the us securities and exchange commission the sec on march   release no  providing conditional relief to public companies that are unable to timely comply with their filing obligations as a result of the novel coronavirus covid outbreak


the companys operations and business have experienced disruption due to the unprecedented conditions surrounding the outbreak of covid thus the company is unable to timely prepare and file its annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march   the annual report that is due june   the original due date therefore the company elected to rely on the conditional filing relief provided under the order

in light of the circumstances and uncertainty surrounding the effects of the covid pandemic on the business employees consultants and service providers of the company and considering the lack of time for the compilation dissemination and review of the information required to be presented and the importance of markets and investors receiving materially accurate information in the annual report the company has determined that it will delay the filing of the annual report by up to  days after the original due date or until august  

amidst the covid outbreak the company experienced a decline in the number of customer visits during the first three months of calendar  due to the implementation of the lockdown policy in china in addition because some of our employees could not come to the workplace we were short of staff which slowed down our logistic service and impacted our customer service at stores however as china is gradually controlling the spread of covid we believe these negative impacts are temporary currently we are unable to accurately predict the future impact of covid due to the developing circumstances and uncertainty surrounding this current pandemic including the ultimate geographic spread of covid the severity of the disease the duration of the outbreak and effectiveness of the actions that may be taken by governmental authorities the management has been closely monitoring the impact caused by covid and we will continue to operate our business as steadily and safely as we can",None,1593191907

IDEX,Things to consider with the $IDEX Hindenburg allegations,"personally i am in for the long with idex i started off wanting to quick flip the stock but after doing hard dd i concluded this was a great company to invest in for the long term i truly believe in the companys vision and fully understand the demand for green energy having worked in the renewable energy sector myself in the past there is plenty of positive dd and pr about idex you can find online so i wont touch on those

if idex was truly a scam it would be the most insane scam to secure a bunch of orders get billion dollar institutions invested do multiple global interviews purchase multiple facilities claim they are working with huge companies like tesla  nissan  etc to fulfill their orders and the list goes on and on keep in mind that these companies care about their public image as well if idex was truly a fraud then these big time corps would come out and announce these claims as fraud because they certainly do not want their reputations slandered

hindenburg as we all know is notorious for shorting companies that are on a positive tear they shorted companies like tesla and shopify in the past most recently they shorted wins on  causing the stock to go from  to  a week or so later the company rebounded to hit a high of  take what they say with a grain of salt

the allegations by hindenburg have yet to be proven true they claim that they had reporters go to the meg center and take videosphotos claimed to have interviewed vendors there as well why are people not questioning these claims first off the video taken shows a banner from   and is a very short  second panorama why not post a video interviewing these vendors isnt qingdao closed off to the public at the moment why would there even be vendors there

hindenburg points out multiple times that idex has failed to respond to these allegations however when the shoe is on the other foot ie people asking hindenburg to verify their claims  hindenburg also remains silent the videosphotos from hindenburg have no time stamps or solid evidence that they are recent to address the photoshopped photos we are in a world wide pandemic the meg center has not been able to have their ribbon cutting ceremony yet which would explain the lack of photos also it is common for photoshop to be used for marketing purposes photoshop is used all the time in real estate when homes are being marketed doesnt mean the home doesnt exist

the community and the bears were silent when the stock was on fire going up but as soon it starts dipping south they start calling it a scam go figure every negative thing is being magnified right now due to the scare however traders and investors need to take a step back and analyze why these allegations would come up in the first place if a company is trash you would just ignore it why spend countless hours trying to debunk a company that is destined for failure anyways why not just let it fall on its own clearly there are ulterior motives

this is just my opinion on the whole situation and if you dont agree then move on im not looking to get in an argument over the internet with some random i have my views and others have theirs however many people were heavily invested in this company and lost lots of money due to claims not proven and scares i advise everyone to do their own research before investing and believe what you hold amazon started in a jenky little room  if you were to look at a photo of amazon back then you wouldve thought it was a scam also

q earnings report in august will do all the talking numbers dont lie not to mention idex has a virtual conference on  with big time investors if the fraud allegations are true then i guess i done goofed however none of the companies and institutions that are connected with ideanomics have come out to speak about any sort of false claims food for thought",None,1593177127

IDEX,"Alright, let’s go over today $IDEX","i am not a professional you also dont have to agree with what i say

alright kids gather round and lets go over today what happened and why i think everything is still okay take a deep breath for those of you who are still holding strong and tell yourself itll be okay because it will be and heres why 

i also want to remind those who may have forgotten if you are still in this and havent sold you havent lost money until you sell for a loss you havent lost money the stocks value has just gone down and most likely only temporary 

idex was heavily heavily attacked by shorts and those who want to see it not progress further than it already has my first theory as to why it dipped as hard as it did and why it was attacked so heavily besides the debunked hindenburg which ill talk about in a min sorry hold on throwing a period in there that run on sentence was a bitch anyways i was thinking and who loses the most out of ideanomics becoming a near future giant in the green energy industry big oil those fucks are so scared because fossil fuel has been their money makers and if the world goes green what the fuck do we need their oil for not nearly as much as we currently do 

 china is the ndhttpswwwworldometersinfooilchinaoil  second biggest oil consumer in the world do you understand what that means if they are going green take a look at this articlehttpswwwgooglecomampsqzcomaschinagreensitseconomythesepeoplebusinessesandnationswillfeelthepinchamp that talks about back in  they were looking to go green and cut out fossil fuels in the future  of ev vehicles accounted for the vehicles in use the fact that idex has now taken the lead on their transformation to green energy is fucking insane in that article it also mention russia and saudi arabia wanting to sell even more crude oil to china

alf mentioned in the interview today how mongolia is rich in mineable materials but its shut down do to micro toxins released into the air from the fossil fuels heavy duty mining vehicles he also said how they have have proven to them that their mining trucks release zero toxins allowing mining to potentially resume do you know how much money is in that alone fuck you and fuck me money 

alf also mentioned how they have their hands in multiple areas of business involving green energy not just ev and hv they literally just signed a deal where they are the number one investors in providing energy for ghttpswwwprnewswirecomnewsreleasesideanomicsmegannouncestheofficiallaunchofitsenergyservicesunitthroughdealwithnewinfrastructureserviceprovidergiantzhongsentowerhtml  thats reoccurring energy that doesnt run out and you know what its fucking cheap way cheaper than crude oil the cost to operate an ev comparedhttpswwwenergysagecomelectricvehiclescostsandbenefitsevsevsvsfossilfuelvehicles to a fossil fuel car is less than half 

and dont you think that all these companies who ideanomics is partneredinvestedin business with would start speaking up if all this was a scam why would they want their namesreputation tarnished they wouldnt and they havent said anything 

alf is a professional he knows the companies worth and he knows what they are going to achieve why the fuck should he have to worry about wether a picture of his meg parking lot is photo shopped or not fuck that noise thats all they are accusing them of and everyone lost their minds they didnt look into anything themselves they just thought oh shit im a pussy who cant think or dd for myself sell pshhh

LLIT,"$LLIT, an outstanding masl play! 🚀🚀","guess what new dd thread 

stock llit lianluo smart ltd 

llit is a call by my friends stantradingman and theonlyrampart for good reason its a covid play with great value which should sustain throughout the duration of and potentially after the covid pandemic 
 

heres a quick outline of my llit thread for reference 

summary 
introduction to llit 
covid hot sector play 
mask usage by countries esp china and usa
lasting value postcovid 
low float another hot sector currently 
 

who is llit lianluo smart ltd located in beijing china 

what does llit do they distribute medical equipment such as sleep apnea machines ventilators and other instruments used in operating rooms intensive care units and emergency rooms across the world oh and masks

 

here is a link to purchase llit masks

httpsmalllianluocomindexphpproducthtml 

i will admit im not an expert in translating mandarin to english but it appears the llit masks are durable and include a batteryoperated filtration device designed for both breathability and protection  

llit is a very diverse company in addition to masks and ventilators they are also a  shareholder in ghsi and play a role in the operation of and may own part of but couldnt confirm the popular ecommerce retailer neweggcom 
 

now that we know more about llit and what they do lets dig into why theyre such a valuable play 

the answer is easy covid is currently the hottest sector of the penny stock market llit is a mask and ventilator distributor from china the epicenter of the cv pandemic 
 

while we cant determine the exact numbers statistacom states asian countries tend to utilize masks more than any other region with china being the secondhighest global percapita utilizer of masks at an  rate vs only  in the us remember llit is in china
  

china has about  billion citizens per the above data roughly  of chinese citizens consistently wear masks yep  billion people in china alone are wearing masks on a daily basis located in beijing llit has the most ideal market for mask distribution in the world 
 

the fact that llit is located in the capital city of the most populous country in the world in a country where over  billion people consistently wear masks means llit not only has the perfect market but an appealing recipe for postcovid value as well 

why is this 
 

well its reasonable to assume masks will have a common household presence after cv is gone because masks are so popular during cv and must be replaced often the demand for masks will likely not just go away once cv is gone thus llit has potential postcv value 
 

another attractive perf of llit is its low float with only  million shares on the market llit is susceptible to rapid movement with a relatively low amount of volume as of late lowfloaters have also been an extremely hot sector best of both worlds two hot sectors 
 

llit has a ton going for it currently not to mention it checks multiple boxes for most appealing penny stocks based on the current market in pennies you gotta play the hot plays man and as you can see llit is scorching hot whats not to love here llit could run huge 
 

so lets recap our llit thread 

distributes masks and ventilators in china 
it is a cv hot sector play 
china has over  billion consistent maskwearers 
it has ample postcovid potential 
its a lowfloater which is a very hot sector currently

how to trade
 price has flattened quite a bit over the last few days wait until the first sign of upwards price action to signify the start of an up trend before you buy 

 sell before announcement on the th when negative price action starts or be brave and hold through the announcement

steven sugarman is out

an sec filing by steven sugarman posted late last night revealshttpssecreportdocument

gtbetween june   and june   commerce home mortgage llc sold all  shares of voting common stock directly owned by it at a weightedaverage share price of  per share

thats right he dumped all his shares into the market and missed out on the ride  so yes this does reveal those were his big sell walls that blocked upward momentum of the stock on thursday and friday until it broke free 

but he also did something extra douchey he attached an fu letter to the board which insinuated that they werent being black enough and that they generally sucked just to be able to get it into the sec record thats some condescending bullshit right there folks

and then made this ridiculous claim
gtin addition we believe that the significant acquisitions of broadway stock last week by parties acting coordinating and trading to further their common goals and agenda constitute a triggering event under the shareholder rights plan implemented by the board in september  we will be providing the board additional correspondence relating to the capital corps rights under the shareholder rights plan including our rights related to the issuance of preferred shares in respect thereof and look forward to discussing the same with broadway

sugarman wants to get some poison pill preferred shares gifted to him by broadway even though he sold all his common stock because he wants to count reddittwitter users as a coordinated effort

SOLO,Updated DD on SOLO Electra Meccanica,"solo gets a lot of flack for looking ugly and i admit on first glance i was confused at what i was looking at but this might be a nice little goldmine for anyone that has patience it also makes nice smaller reliable gains rather than a lot of the  gainers we have been seeing lately then they dump back to half the price again

i am in k shares of solo at  for transparency but here are my recent thoughts on solo and why i think this is one of the better investmentsswing trades to consider over the weekend

first of all electra meccanica just released some pr that they are expanding their retail footprint for the flagship solo in oregon and arizona this is exciting news for a few reasons

 this is prime territory for their ev considering harsh winter weather could make their product unmarketable in certain areas of the us this starts them off strong with them having plans to expand throughout the country over the next  months  years globally
 oregon provides a cool  rebate as an incentive for evs california 
 arizona is rumored to be the location of their new us production plant and a new retail awareness through arizona creates speculation as to whether this could be one of their locations for an ev factory nikola tesla and others also have ev factories located in arizona coincidentally

other recent news suggests that electra meccanica is essentially on their final stages of the solo premiere they are also willing to be patient to execute their plans as precisely as possible and this means the actual us launch of the solo could lean towards augustearly september it could be earlier it could be later

why do i suggest buying in now after watching solo for  weeks i have analyzed the movement and price strength and here are the results

 highest price  in ah  in market hours
 lowest price  in ah  all time lows
 median price range  ah  market hours

so essentially if played right there is an almost  difference in just about a weeks worth of price movement based on only  pr release httpsinvestorselectrameccanicacompressreleasesdetailelectrameccanicarespondstoeconomicreopeningwithhttpsinvestorselectrameccanicacompressreleasesdetailelectrameccanicarespondstoeconomicreopeningwith and regular price movement based on upcoming catalysts

upcoming catalysts

 introduction of new us factory
 official news on the launch of the solo set for release in los angeles late 
 speculation on the solo gen  the tofino or the eroadster
 confirmation of number of preorder sales rumored to be around 
 any other legitimate pr

fundamentally solo seems like one of the safest bets you can make in todays recent volatile market the look does not please everyone some have blatantly said they despise it but that is also what makes it so special set up to either succeed majorly in todays covid and clean energy climate or majorly fail but my gut tells me that this company believes in their product like no tomorrow and will do everything they can to see all their plans come to fruition

the ceo stated in an interview they need focus on the launch of the solo and once that is complete they can focus on other projects like the tofino more closely  is the year of the solo

as of tonight solo sits right below my buy in price and i believe that is an good price for a potential buy in a dip to  is possible but solo jumps nicely on good volume and has a relatively low float compared to some stocks so if solo does break out again it should move relatively fast and break  no sweat potentially more no fomo here just a solid company product and future outlook you dont have to like the look yourself however i can see this becoming a cool niche ev that people could find attractive thanks to rebates and a unique sporty look",Research,1592607944

BYFC,Historically black Broadway Federal Bank ($BYFC) in hostile takeover - #BlackLivesMatter,"on a day when nys historically blackcentric carver bancorp carv soared to as high as   in the morning and closed  one must ask why the similar broadway financial corp bfyc in la which also serves the africanamerican community hadnt likewise seen such gains yet

on tuesday bfyc was as low as  yesterday it was as high as  before settling at   at close at the end of ah trading it suddenly shot up to   yet in premarket trading it was pushed back down to  before retail traders would even have the ability to get into it 

why is it being kept down lets follow the breadcrumbs back to one person with a financial interest in keeping bfyc depressed 

background

broadway federal bank was founded in  by early black civilrights leaders including businessman and dentist h claude hudsonhttpsenwikipediaorgwikihclaudehudson and famed architect paul r williamshttpsenwikipediaorgwikipaulrwilliams specifically to offer banking services to the underserved minorities in la 

its a federally chartered sampl bank but shockingly the last traditionally africanamerican community bank headquartered on the west coast

since going public in  of course it is no longer considered blackowned since anyone can buy shares  but its explicit missionhttpswwwbroadwayfederalbankcomhistory is to serve the real estate financial and business needs of customers in underserved urban communities

the current ceo is waynekent bradshawhttpswwwlatimescombusinesslafihimibradshawstoryhtml who took over in  since then he has steadily grown the balance sheet

financials
 q  the assets were m
 by q  they were m 
 and by q hit m 

at the same time deposits have increased from m last year to m last quarter

bradshaw has done this by refocusing attention on expanding the portfolio of loanshttpswwwkcrwcomnewsshowsgreaterlahowthewestsonlyblackbankhasevolvedtheevolutionofthewestsonlyblackbank for class c multifamily units  lowercost housing in the range of m to m which tends to be below what bigger banks will touch according to bradshaw however our average borrower probably has a net worth of  million

barbarians at the gates

all this unfortunately hasnt been reflected in the value of the stock price which has under m shares outstanding so at its low point of the year  it had a market cap of barely m that would be a cheap price to pay for a company that holds half a billion dollars in assets and over m in deposits

this hasnt escaped the notice of outside parties those who would try to buy out the bank entirely taking it private to get a taste of those sweet sweet assets

in answer to that threat in september  the board of directors enacted a shareholders rights planhttpswwwbusinesswirecomnewshomeenbroadwayfinancialcorporationannouncesadoptionstockholderrights aka poison pill which would give additional voting rights to existing shareholders if anyone attempted to acquire over  of the company  as a way to prevent such a takeover

but one such person is trying steven sugarman former ceo of banc of california who resigned in  under dubious circumstanceshttpswwwocregistercombancofcaliforniaceoresignsfollowingsecprobe which included a criminal investigation 

just after losing his ceo gig sugarman founded the capital corps as his own personal financial fiefdom and then acquired lender commerce home mortgage as a subsidiary

it might also be worth mentioning that sugarman is shall we say not black and has no personal interest or connection to the africanamerican community

in february through his companies sugarman acquired a ton of byfchttpssecreportdocument   or m shares  just under the poison pill threshold this made him the largest single shareholder in the company

he did so through commerce home mortgage and immediately sent a letter to the board of broadway federal saying that they wanted to buy the company demanding a meeting and to drop the whole poison pill thing

ceo bradshaw wrote back a neutrally worded letterhttpswwwbroadwayfederalbankcommediabroadwayfedpdffinancialhighlightsbroadwayfinancialcorporationkfebasfiledpdf to the effect of well get back to you on that

oh no you didnt

sugarman didnt like the sound of that  and had his underlings draft a stern reply with threats of litigationhttpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardataddexhtm which further went into how much broadway sucks and how broadways board should listen to them and do everything they said or else

on april  the capital corps tried to float an unsolicited offer to buy out the bankhttpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardataddexhtm for  or m which they called a premium of approximately  to the day average closing price of the companys common stock

naturally the board rejected this tenderhttpswwwreuterscomarticlebriefcapitalcorpsllcsaysonmaydebriefcapitalcorpsllcsaysonmaydeliveredlettertobroadwayfinancialsboardidusfwncqe which represented less than a tenth of the assets held by the bank 

but sugarman wasnt done he decided he was going to run his own candidates for the board and have a proxy fight thus try to take over the company from within

only opps apparently commerce home mortgage wasnt a shareholder on record as of may httpswwwbusinesswirecomnewshomeenbroadwayfinancialcorporationfilessupplementproxystatement and thus commerce is not eligible under broadways bylaws to nominate a candidate for election to broadways board of directors

so thats where things stand right now  and the annual shareholders meeting is just one week away

manipulation

remember that sugarman had control of over m shares it would be in his companys interest to continue to depress byfcs stock price to at or below its tendered amount  otherwise they may not be able to buy it outright

certainly they could no longer claim to be giving it a fair valuation if the stock was now twice or more what it had been when they floated their offer just a few months ago

thus it would be trivial for them to sell small amounts into the market keeping the price artificially low

however this may not last much longer if the price keeps going up through pumping or retail interest sugarman will have no recourse but to give up his takeover attempts and sell his holdings and take the profits

IDEX,To my IDEX people,"just wanted to remind everyone who might feel like they missed out on idex and are waiting to buy tomorrow morning remember that idex is a company with pretty questionable history and while they look promising with their ev deals more often than not penny stocks are just pumped and dumpedthey rarely become billiondollar companies

and to people who are certain that idex will become a billiondollar company or will x in value just remember that top trading firms have the smartest ivyleague graduates working with the most sophisticated tools to predict stock prices if anyone could predict the next gnus it would be them but rarely do they predict the next billiondollar penny stock in fact even a  gain on their portfolio would put them way ahead of any other firm leave alone  or  gain

even if you did end up making money on gnus by betting it all and make money on idex in a similar way in the long run such a strategy is guaranteed to lose money otherwise these hedge funds would be making  profit a year not struggling to barely beat the market amp be happy when they make  profit

with that in mind feel free to invest in idex if you believe it will go to the moon",Discussion,1592428748

GNUS,Twas the night before GNUS app launch...,"twas the night before gnus launch when all through the house

not a ticker was stirring not even a mouse

the stocks were all bought by traders with care

in hopes that a moon launch soon would be there

the traders were nestled all snug in their beds

while visions of gnus glory danced in their heads

and mamma in her kerchief and i in an anxious hell

had just settled our brains to wait for the opening bell

when out internet there arose such a clatter

i sprang to my laptop to see what the hell was the matter

to google to the news i searched like a flash

another great update to help up our cash

cbs netflix and disney all in on the show

gave a luster of midday to objects below

when what to my wondering eyes did appear

but posts about arnold buying up stocks around here

with a little due diligence  so lively and quick

i knew in a moment this wasnt a trick

more rapid than eagles his coursers they came

and he whistled and shouted and called them by name

now disney now amazon now cbs and listen

on hulu on vudu on pluto television

to the top of the stock market to the top of the wall

up and away up and away nothing can cause us to fall

as leaves that before the wild hurricane fly

when they meet with an obstacle they mount to the sky

so up to the moon our share values flew

we will all buy a sleigh full of toys and some garbage stocks too

and then in a twinkling i heard on the roof

the stamping and pawing of each bullish hoof

as i drew in my head and was turning around

down the chimney stan lee came out with a bound

he was dressed for success from his head to his foot

and his clothes were  untarnished by the ashes and soot

a bundle of cash he had flung on his back

his final works had brought gnus back",Shitpost,1592180793

XSPA,My 2 cents on XSPA,"my  cents on xspa

so everyone holding xspa seems to be shitting their pants just want to give my opinion on it keep in mind i dont know shit and this is speculation on my half everyone was guessing that the rs from yesterday was to take xspa from a penny stock and introduce it to the big boys aka hedge funds however there could be another perspective were not looking at perhaps xspa could have foreseen an impending tumble in the stock market today is a blood bath for the bears in the dow in general maybe xspa board did the rs to keep the stock on the nasqad as it would have fallen under  today and would have been delisted to otc on monday i think xspa is still in talks with other airports but maybe this nd wave of corona news is scaring airports and they are now hasty to reopen flights back up this is probably causing a delay in xspa securing contracts 
look at some of the facts at am est today there was k volume movement in the min time frame big volume price for asking went all the way up to  in that time this could have been when the fund managers were getting in however then the dow took a  point shit when the market opened this probably scared off the big boys and they likely pulled immediately out the rest of the day the dow nasdaq and the sampp all went to bear slide city everything is down people not just xspa do your dd and realize that the airports will one day have to reopen and now with this nd wave bs flying around they will have to invest into testing hold strong brothers the gains will take your account to levels you never imagined it will take time it will take heart and courage it will take hand strength training but i honestly believe this will be a rocket like we havent seen before off to the tendie galaxy

my preorder is xx and they confirmed to me that yes they have almost k preorders a rough dirty math estimate places them at  in preorders obviously before any up sells in price and also debits for overhead they are planning a massive nyc launch as well virus stopped this from happening sooner but the vehicles are currently on generation  of design not exact but this new version with the refined interior and led lights is currently green lit for production just needing final tooling to flip the switch as investor relations told me

ill be getting my solo in nyc as soon as possible to start a channel on life with a single seat electric vehicle as i personally always needed transport like this and i cant believe on my birthday they called me back to discuss the vehicle further

this company is as real as it gets and to think gnus on kids cartoons is above an actual product that made m easy in sales once again shipping is the only factor keeping them held up considering final tooling is not such a problem for their most die hard fan base in la

most stocks do a at least a  split and many do splits of  to make that  compliance farther away look at acb for example they did a  split think about why xspa chose  the were probably going to meet compliance on their own  gets them just enough to get over the  hump they did this to get out of penny land to get the big money in here once they are able to invest in this i think it will take off fast

i have mixed feelings about motley fool but i stumbled upon this write up after doing more research on the ccus market

i havent looked into the companys financials any more than this article heres what i learned 

june  signed deal with drax power in uk for its carbon capture

nov  entered into a m  year deal with exxonmobil

fuel cell generation backlog has doubled in value to b since  w a total backlog of b  projects totaling  mw for reference a mw is enough energy to power  homes 

also nov  got eight year m loan to work on those projects in the backlog

dont substitute this for your own research but im bullish on renewable energy across the board and with fcels strike price of  it seems like a great time to get in i wouldnt expect money bags to roll in anytime soon but keep it on your radar

ampxb

xspa took a big hit from covid being forced to close all locations due to being nonessential and therefore loosing all revenue from my understanding this is what caused the ticker to drop from  to  

ampxb

april th   xpresspa group hires dr lewis lipsey as first chief medical director for its xprestest subsidiary  we are thrilled to be adding doctor lipsey to our executive management team he has over  years of experience as a medical doctor and is uniquely qualified to oversee novel coronavirus covid screening and testing at us airports he will be a valued asset and advisor to the company during these unprecedented times  doug satzman xpresspa group ceo here is where i start getting pretty bullish on this stock will covid still be a global issue by the time they are up and operating covid tests in every airport personally yes but who knows but that is not why i am investing this company is willing to make huge swings to what they do to meet the public need as well as being socially responsible 

may nd    jump from day prior xpresspa signs contract with jfk international air terminal for covid screening and testing location this site will hold nine seperate testing rooms with a capacity to administer over  tests per day this number is very low but i guess they are only planning on testing pilots and staff at this time future goal to test passengers there will be more of contracts as many as  total

 httpswwwmacrotrendsnetstockschartsxspaxpresspafinancialstatementshttpswwwmacrotrendsnetstockschartsxspaxpresspafinancialstatements here is a link to their financials i dont really know what i am looking at some advice would be much appreciated but from what i can tell these guys have no money and are in debt they just received a m loan from the fed to get covid testing up and running

WORK,HOW DAY TRADES WORK,"since ive been seeing a lot of people asking day trade questions here lately i thought id write up a little breakdown on the bare basics im not an expert if anyone who knows more about this than me probably a lot of you see something wrong or misleading let me know and ill change it

 day trade limits

if you use  of your  day trades it wont clear for  trading days this means if i use a day trade on wednesday that day trade wont be available to me again until wednesday of the next week wednesday thursday friday monday tuesday  trading days

this only applies to those who have less than k in their instant or gold account portfolios

 day trades only count if you buy then sell a stock on the same day

if you have  shares of shit and sell some or all of those shares you can still buy another  shares on the same day without using a day trade however if you have  shares from yesterday sell  buy another  and then try to sell any of them even just  share that will use a day trade because youre selling a share of a stock you bought that day

basically you can sell and then buy but you cant buy and then sell without using a day trade

 stop lossestrailing stopslimit sells count

lets say you buy  shares of shit and immediately set a trailing stop loss on some or all of those shares setting the trailing stop loss wont count as a day trade unless it executes if it executes on the same day thats a day trade if it executes the next trading day or later its not be cautious if youve already used all  day trades and you set up a stop loss on a stock you bought and it executes the same day you bought the stock itll push you over your  day trade limit

 if youre newuncertain keep pattern day trade protection on

if you dont know what would constitute a day trade dont shut pattern day trade protection off a little popup will appear every time you try to execute something that would be considered a day trade to warn you thats what youre doing if youve already used all of your day trades this popup doesnt happen unless all of your day trades are used but itll at least keep you in compliance so you can avoid the  day penalty for going over",Discussion,1591195352

 the global picture

at th april  a studyhttpswwwpreprintsorgmanuscriptv has been published about the potential use of medicinal cannabis to combat covid it wasnt a surprise that this caught the medias eyes and attention cannabis farms and biotechnology went a bit in the green at the time  this could be causation instead of correlation judge it yourself

the study could be biased since its published by a cannabisfocused biotech companyhttpsinplantabiotechnologycom on the website preprints researchers can publish their paper on preprintshttpswwwdwcomencoronavirusthetideiscomingformedicinalcannabisa without a previous rigorous peer review 

it doesnt really matter whether this published report is reliable or not i see more and more cbdcannabisoriented bio companies ie avicanna inchttpsfinanceyahoocomquoteavcntopavcntoamptsrcfinsrch therapix bioscienceshttpsfinanceyahoocomquotetrpxptrpxamptsrcfinsrch and curaleafhttpsfinanceyahoocomquotecurlfpcurlfamptsrcfinsrch  rising from the bottom nowadays 

we have to take advantage of the current situation right of the bat pun intended dont chase the pump but jump in beforehand

 what about therapix biosciences ltd trpx

therapix biosciences ltd a specialty clinicalstage pharmaceutical company develops drugs based on cannabinoid molecules 

they have four pipeline drugs all in development and one of them in phase b never been profitable and probably wont be in the near term

but what could drive this stock upwards 

 well the possible play of a pump and dump by rumors of a covid vaccine or better theyll announce a trial to study or develop a possible covid cure with the help of cannabis components 
 good press releases about their current pipeline
 a new ceohttpsfinanceyahoocomnewstherapixbiosciencesannouncesappointmentceohtml with a degree in economy and finance   years of experience in the industry this could make the ceo a bit sketchy since he may be here for the money only just look for possible inside buying and selling of him to keep track of the company he may want to temporarily push the stock higher for personal needs
 news about the reverse mergerhttpsfinanceyahoocomnewstherapixpursuesreversemergercbdhtml that was talked about  months ago the news about this is almost certain to happen 

ampxb

 so whats our plan captain

as of this moment the stock suddenly skyrocketed  in the last  minutes i searched for any indicators but couldnt find any thats why i decided to jump off at  with  shares with an entree of  i believe this was caused by fomo and the stock will fall tomorrow 

i suspect that it will reach  this week if not tomorrow this stock has proven time by time that it cant hold for long after a peak the previous press releases were not astonishing enough to support but the support is raising slowing as time passes by it went from  to  to  

play the peaks guys buy when theres no hype sell when theres sudden hype but no news hold when theres hype and news

what is wet amd
 wet amd is also known as wet agerelated macular degeneration
 in the wet type of macular degenerationhttpswwwmacularorgwetamd abnormal blood vessels known as choroidal neovascularization or cnv grow under the retina and macula these new blood vessels may then bleed and leak fluid causing the macula to bulge or lift up from its normally flat position thus distorting or destroying central vision under these circumstances vision loss may be rapid and severe
 right now the three standard forms of treatment for wet amd is eylea  lucentis amp bevacizumab linkhttpswwwwebmdcomeyehealthmaculardegenerationqawhatarethetreatmentsforwetmaculardegeneration link httpswwwmayoclinicorgdiseasesconditionswetmaculardegenerationdiagnosistreatmentdrc

what is dme
 it is also known as diabetic macular edema
 in people with diabetes too much blood sugar can damage the tiny blood vessels at the back inner wall of the eye retina or block them completely this condition is diabetic retinopathy sometimes tiny bulges microaneurysms protrude from the vessel walls leaking or oozing fluid and blood into the retina this fluid can cause swelling edema in the central part of the retina macula this is a serious eye complication called diabetic macular edemahttpswwwmayoclinicorgdiseasesconditionsdiabeticretinopathymultimediadiabeticmacularedemaimg that can cause vision problems or blindness
 as previously mentioned with wet amd the standard form of treatment right now for patients with dme is the use of eylea amp lucentishttpswwwwebmdcomeyehealthdiabeticmacularedematreatment

what is brvo
 brvo is also known as branch retinal vein occlusion
 arteries and veins carry blood throughout your body including your eyes the eyes retina has one main artery and one main vein when branches of the retinal vein become blocked it is called branch retinal vein occlusion brvo when the vein is blocked blood and fluid spills out into the retina the macula can swell from this fluid affecting your central vision eventually without blood circulation nerve cells in the eye can die causing a loss of vision
 just like the previous two the standard form of treatment applies to brvo as well which is eylea amp lucentishttpswwwnvisioncenterscomconditionsbranchretinalveinocclusion

what are the current forms of treat for the mentioned eye diseases
 current form of treatment is known as antivegf drugshttpswwwncbinlmnihgovpmcarticlespmcstitle
those antivegf drugs are bevacizumab lucentis amp eylea
 bevacizumab
  bevacizumab is also known as avastin avastin is the brand name for the drug which is called bevacizumab it blocks the growth of abnormal blood vessels in the back of the eyehttpswwwaaoorgeyehealthdrugsavastin those blood vessels can leak and affect vision causing vision loss from wet amd and diabetic eye disease
 lucentis
  lucentis is the brand name for the drug which is called ranibizumab it works by keeping new blood vessels from forminghttpswwwdrugscomlucentishtml under the retina a sensory membrane that lines the inside of the eye in people with certain types of eye disorders new blood vessels grow under the retina where they leak blood and fluid
 eylea
  eylea is a type of drug called a vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor it reduces leaking from blood vesselshttpswwwmedicalnewstodaycomarticleseylea in the eye and slows down the growth of new blood vessels

how does lytenava work as treatment
 it is a fulllength humanized antivegf vascular endothelial growth factor recombinant monoclonal antibody or mab that inhibits vegf and associated angiogenic activityhttpswwwbiospacecomarticlereleasesoutlooktherapeuticsannounceslytenavabevacizumabvikganticipatedbrandnameforonsifapproved with wet amd abnormally high levels of vegf are secreted in the eye vegf is a protein that promotes the growth of new abnormal blood vessels antivegf injection therapy blocks this growth
 if it is approved it will become the first fda approved opthalmic formulation of bevacizumab 
 it is a very big deal in this particular industry because the standard regular bevacizumab accounts for an estimated  of all wet amd prescriptions in the united stateshttpsoutlooktherapeuticscomlytenavaoverview

overview of their pipeline product lytenava
 if approved and commercialized for ophthalmic use ons has the potential to helphttpsoutlooktherapeuticscompipelineunmetpatientneeds address the existing quality safety and availability issues associated with repackaged iv bevacizumab from compounding pharmacists eg cgmpquality control issues product shortages inconsistent potency sterility issues and liability risks associated with offlabel unregulated use of repackaged bevacizumab
 ons has the potential if approved and commercialized with a responsible pricing strategy to help lower the aggregate costs of treating retinal diseases for the overall healthcare system
 doctors who wish to treat their retinal patients with a less expensive antivegf drug often use bevacizumab but because there is no fdaapproved ophthalmic formulation of bevacizumab doctors must use repackaged iv bevacizumab provided by compounding pharmacists the repackaged intravenous iv bevacizumab for ophthalmic use that is provided by compounding pharmacies can carry known risks of contamination and inconsistent potency with potentially severe consequences as leading retinal societies have reported to combat this outlook firmly believes that lytenava will avoid the potential safety sterility potency availability and syringe drawbackshttpsoutlooktherapeuticscompipelinerepackagedbevacizumab that can occur with repackaged intravenous iv bevacizumab from compounding pharmacies

risks involved
 as with everything good in life there are always risks present
 one of the biggest risks is if the topline data from the studies that will be announced in august are not good then it will cause big problems from the company as everything that they are is behind this product being successful
 another risk as stated on their latest sec filingshttpsiroutlooktherapeuticscomnodehtml on march   we received written notification from the nasdaq stock market llc or nasdaq indicating that as of march   we were not in compliance with nasdaq listing rule a for continued listing on the nasdaq capital market as the minimum bid price of our listed securities was less than  per share for the previous  consecutive business days
  they have been given until december th  to reach compliance if they do not reach compliance they run the risk of being delisted from nasdaq and begin trading in the overthecounter markets if we are not successful in regaining compliance with nasdaqs continued listing standards which may negatively impact the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets

final thoughts amp comments
 for starters i will get this out of the way as i usually do please do not see the stock symbol and then blindly make purchases tomorrow when the market opens please read each and every single link sec amp presentation i have linked to my posts
 i want you guys to read this post and obtain as much knowledge as possible so you can make the best well informed decision on your own
anyways as for myself alongside with my previous dd post i do not have any shares in this stock but tomorrow i will definitely purchase  shares tomorrow as i myself truly am confident in this company and their products
  i feel so confident in them because of the two new board members theyve brought in the manufacturing agreement with fujifilm the agreement to streamline their capital and secure  of net profits of future sales of lytenava amp because theyve been on track with their clinical studies

anyways i hope this dd helped you guys make a decision on this stock if this is one that has been on your mind lately if not then at the very least i hope it was at least an interesting read 

take care everyone hope you guys enjoy this dd",Research,1590494722

BAND,YOU BAND OF MERRY MEN &amp; WOMEN - REGARDING ROBINHOOD’S EXTENDED TRADING HOURS,"  

good afternoon my fellow robin hooders

allow me to introduce myself i am but a weary robinhooder for the past many yearsmonths twas robinhood that drew me into trading due to its ease of use amp welldefined visuals

however i dont know about you but im pretty tired of watching other people makesell shares while we dedicated robin hooders sit on the side idle wishinghoping we could make moves as the prices soar to the heavens or plummet to the nine depths of hell 

due to this inability to make said moves i hope all of us will take the time to band together becoming one resounding voice of merry men amp women united for a common cause allowing all our voices to ring out from the depths of sherwood forest to the hallowed halls within the castle of nottingham to say nah we will not stand for these lousy extended hours

to help the common cause all i ask is for the following

from your desktop

 in robinhood click on the account section

 under account click on contact us section

 for the category select general questions

 for the topic select feature requests

 click the continue button

 copy amp paste the below information

 click send

hopefully this will make a difference

ampxb



ampxb

hello robinhood

thank you for taking the time to read my email as i find the following feature request very important not only for myself but also for your longstanding clients and soon to be future clients

there seems to be some major discourse taking place with your clients myself included regarding robinhoods extended hours or lack thereof i have found that more amp more people are leaving robinhood due to the lack of extended hour trading and going to various competitors of yours im sure youre aware of which competitors i speak of so i wont waste your time or my time to list them

here are a couple of questions i would like answered

 why does robinhood only allow for extended trading mins prior to the market opening

 does robinhood plan on addressing the major issue of client retention due to the lack of extended hours trading

a if so how

 as a gold member or potential gold member could robinhood provide gold members the additional capability to have additional extended hour trading like your competitors currently have

i appreciate you taking the time to review and respond to my concerns

all the best

MARK,"$MARK - Walmart, Disney, other big names are partnering with this AI Based Thermal Imaging company","remark holdings inc nasdaq mark is flying in the market today and its nothing new for several trading sessions the stock has traded on either single or doubledigit gains
the gains started when the company announced that it started shipping ai based thermal imaging technology to customers in the united states and japan about two weeks ago recent evidence shows that one of these customers may be walmart inc nyse wmt but theres much more to this than walmart articlehttpsalphastocknewscomremarkholdingsmarkstocktheresmoretoitthanwalmart

dd done by informed observer

mark remains in default on mm of debt owed to mgg which delivered its notice of acceleration to the company on march  the  day period to cure the default ends tomorrow mark is likely able to meet this obligation under the terms of its mm common stock purchase agreement with aspire capital fund signed april   however it comes at the cost of additional dilution for shareholders particularly in the context of marks intrinsic value

mark is also in the process of resolving the risk that it is delisted from the nasdaq for failure to maintain a  per share valuation for a ninety day period the requirement for curing the notice of delisting is for marks shares to close above  per share for  consecutive trading days before by my estimate the nd of may

the resolution of these two controversies remove two important catalysts which have been central to the short seller thesis and is likely to contribute to short covering

the company still has to finish its  audit and it is unclear to me covid notwithstanding why this has taken so long since the sale of the companys vegascom was completed in may  the good news is that marks auditor has not resigned and the companys past audits have been qualified with going concern risk language so at this point the auditors opinion letter cant get much worseunless they refuse to provide an opinionwhich should already have been announced if it was going to happen

as we get closer to marks restated q and fy  k filing and update call on thursday may market focus will shift to the contents and substance of the companys narrative regarding the status of its kankan ai business with particular emphasis on names of clients and the size of contacts and the implications for twelve month revenues and cash flow there has been a lot of speculation on these issues in the past three weeks much of it informed by the companys own tweets which is a business practice that many appropriately believe hurts the organizations credibility

mark management needs to be clear and precise on their call on the th about the status size and duration of contracts even if ndas prevent them from naming clients and provide investors with  month revenue and margin guidance openended statements about the scope of the thermal imaging and ai opportunity as they have done on past calls when talking about the china business without reference to real contracts is insufficient given the companys twitter teases about wynn simon property group disney or was there a different source et al the call needs to expand upon not regurgitate the substance of the companys rare and effective official statement of april 

it is hard to know the number of outstanding mark shares at the moment but reasonable to assume that it is markedly higher than the mm last reported on september   nevertheless the value of marks investment in sharecare which remains impaired by marks default on the mgg loan has appreciated by more based on the revaluation of the telehealth sector which is up  with the outbreak of covid than the increase in marks share count which has a share cap of  under the aspire agreement

the value of the sharecare investment once unencumbered by mggs lien likely supports a mark share price that is x marks current share price the value on the kankan ai business and any contracts that the company has secured in the last six months or will secure in the next six months is all incremental to the value of mark uncertainties remain over the next several days however their resolution and the fact that mark will own the narrative thereafter and may actually announce contracts creates an attractive setup and demands attention",Research,1589548659

final thoughts amp comments
 as i always tell you guys this is just a very detailed post containing as much useful information i could find and write about so you guys can read and make your own well informed decision at the end of the day it is upto you if you decide to purchase shares and how much youll purchase what im doing for you is that i want to give you guys the best knowledge possible before you make your decision

 i genuinely believe in their products and i believe in their ceos and i believe in the merger 
 the way they are handling and changing courses for this year has been incredibly successful so far amp the proof is there with those sales and with beating set expectations of them by wide margins
 not only that but theyre responsible with the new large amounts of cash theyve received and the proof is there with them fully paying off their debt
 plus the ceos of assertio amp zyla who will be running the newly merged company have  amp  years of experience and have previously held high ranking positionshttpinvestorassertiotxcomstaticfilesbabedcbdd with bayer abbot laboratories pharmaceutical division enzon pharmaceuticals amp horizon therapeutics

 for those reasons mentioned above i firmly believe this company will be trading higher than the  target price
 i personally own  shares of asrt
 ill be holding these shares through qq

i hope this post helps you guys out and i hope everyone has a great day amp hope you all have been having a good week as well ",Research,1589519115

there is also one drug in their pipeline which is awaiting approval from the fda i read that this is a kind of a breakthrough and theyll likely be bought out by another major biotech

comment ive been doing some research into finding the next nvax for us i recall reading that gilead had competition and i started looking at other adenosine analogues that are being tested right now with gilds remdesivir being the most known one currently i came across galidesivir and it is made by the publicly traded company biocryst bcrx  there are other adenosine analogues but they didnt have anything noteworthy going on it looks like bcrx is currently conducting and winding down a clinical study in brazil so results should be posted soon in the coming daysweeks estimated study completion date is  and they started in april 

this is just pure speculation and hypothesis but looking at the molecular data for both drugs i would think that galidesivir is the more stable of the two since it can be stored at a higher temperature in powder form without denaturing also it being easier to store would potentially make it the more popular of the two especially in clinics where getting a medical grade freezer that reaches  to c may be hard for reference galidesivir can be stored at c in powder form unlike remdesivir which must be stored in the aforementioned range furthermore if we look at the molecular weights of the two drugs we see that galidesivir is much lighter and lower molecular weights are generally correlated with an increase in biological activity of the drug better uptake in laymans terms i would think that the results from galidesivirs study will be good if not better than gilds remdesivir study",Research,1589356820

my intention for my posts is to provide enough info with enough time for you to follow up with your own dd and make a highquality decision before the gains occur post is my opinion only and not a suggestion to buy current position none intended position  of portfolio  weeks 

stkl  sunopta plant and fruit based foods and proprietary processes current price 

where originally found big money screener  looks for highly rated inexpensive companies with strong price momentum this screen first selects only companies that have a favorable or neutral analyst ranks a strong buy broker rating and a good pricesales ratio next only the stocks with the strongest price movements are kept

reason to investigate further crossed  day moving average on  and has shown no signs of stopping once that resistance line was broken  recent consistent increase in volume

quick fa recent earnings growth over previous quarters each of its business units has proprietary products and services that give it a solid competitive advantage in its sector zacks industry rank st out  gt held by institutions excellent value at current prices to sales  and price to book of 

what i like the technical setup of the stock is supportive of higher prices the stock has outperformed the market over the last  trading days when compared to the sampp  over the last  trading sessions there has been more volume on up days than on down days indicating that stkl is under accumulation short term fundamentals analyst consensus strong buybuy with recent upgrades as recently as of today 

what i do not like price has already jumped significantly expected earnings disaster in august after previous growth not a lot of fa to work with here insider buying came to an end recently around  at an average price range of  according to vickers this boat may have already sailed

decision and trade idea rare personal decision to trade mostly on recent technical analysis and assumption fundamental trend will remain and new price channel is forming until earnings head and shoulders inverse completed on  and has been running ever since short term  intermediate trade only without major news or turnaround what i am looking for tuesday pullback in price as rsi is exiting oversold territory ideal entry point  or lower stop loss  below buy in price target and planned exit    for a riskreward ratio of 

additional notes stop buy placed at  as potential risk vs reward starts to diminish will reassess every  i personally wont take a position tuesday unless it dips to my buy target of  or better i have been looking to add food industries to my portfolio but not restaurants this does have long term potential if they can put out some pr to help me feel like q wont be a complete disaster currently also added similar but not penny stock mgpi to my portfolio

CHFS,"[DD] $CHFS – sleeper COVID play, earnings tomorrow","chf solutions chfs makes a fdaapproved device called aquadex that filter excess fluid out of your bloodstream the machine sells for  but the real moneymaker is the  filters that get changed regularly and between patients 

why is this a covid play because covid causes fluid imbalances in your body that are difficult to manage with aquadex your doctor hooks you up to the filter and it manages the water content of your bloodstream automatically the who designated fluid management as a key problem in effective covid treatmenthttpsappswhointirishandle

before covid chf struggled to get these things into hospitals but now aquadex units are selling like hotcakes chf has had to rapidly scale up their productionhttpirchfsolutionscomnewsreleasesnewsreleasedetailschfsolutionsdoublesproductionstaffaquadexsmartflowtm to keep up with demand in nyc alone they have increased the number of units by httpirchfsolutionscomnewsreleasesnewsreleasedetailschfsolutionsannouncesincreaseutilizationaquadextherapy doctors love these things because the automated fluid management frees up mdnurse staffdialysis so they can treat the trillion other patients flooding their er it also more controlled than diuretic medications and avoids side effects once the units are in hospitals they will get used and those  filters keep getting rolled out the door 

this company has a dogged history it struggled to get on its feet early on flipflopping between products and reverse splitting its stock to hell to stay compliant further they really failed in marketing a great product if you look at their balance sheet for last year they burn tons of cash on admin and marketing without much to show for it i think for those reasons a lot of investors  myself included  were or are not bullish on management longterm however covid is turning out to be the exposure they needed to push product and for once they are actually rising to the opportunity and pushing 

the play is to pick up shares if you pick up tomorrow at premarket opening youll be in before earnings are released now you can dump after earnings or hold for the duration of covid  their next quarter will be probably also be stellar 

my position chfs x  long although i might pick up a couple thousand more premarket tomorrow",Research,1589225865

REAL,"TIPS: How to create a REAL stock DD, and how to spot a ""Pump &amp; Dump"" scam post","there have been too many retarded posts on here that look something like guys  laughing corporation ticker lmao is gonna hit the moon  its only  i think itll hit  by tomorrow  buy buy buy im already a majority shareholder with  ownership of stock  they just announced a new product insert link of sketchy website with penis pill ads

this is not how you do a dd this is the sign of a pump scam  how many have there been here  mvis rttr uavs need i go on  however i dont want this sub to go to hell and become a total shitshow like rpennystocks did where half the posts are scams so i want to give you guys some tips on how to write a dd and separate the good ones from the fucking stupid ones

 state the company their sector and why their stock price is so low  lets face it if a stock is a penny stock the company is either new as a baby or just downright a shitty investment  and theres no way that we on this sub a bunch of sweaty losers with the collective iq of a squirrel have more vision or insight than blackrock or goldman sachs unless you can give us solid proof  state why the stock price is so low and why that is an opportunity to invest dont give vague descriptions of products or mergers or why the company is great  state the companys vision products developments and find legitimate sources  if youve never heard of the publication guess what  its probably not the most reliable source
 do a quick rundown of the last quarterly financials or at least credible speculation of the next earnings call  if you dont know how to read an sec filing learn it  it takes  hours and is the single most useful thing to learn when you want to value a company because thats what investing is valuing the worth of a company not gambling that the price will go up
 look at the company technicals  rsi macd stochastic k or d etc  again if you dont know how to read these learn it because it takes an hour and dictates how you will conduct most of your trades  lets forget that mvis was a scam for a second  judging by the prices some of you bought in when the rsi reading was at  meaning you just fucked your wallet without lube because you couldnt spend  minutes this isnt an exaggeration of time it literally takes  minutes reading a couple of indicators  this determines whether the current price youre buying at is a true bargain or if you either a missed the best time to buy or b should wait for the right time to buy  state the technicals here  heres a tip use tradingview if you dont already look at indicators  its free and you can use up to  indicators with the free version

any stock dd that lacks  of the  things stated here is probably a scam pump amp dump or shitty investment  on top of tips on this sub please do your own research dyor  it will save your ass and your wallet from getting fucked  confirm what people say double then triple check and enter at your own peril  dont point fingers at other users and claim theyre guilty of your limited edition red color trading account patent pending  another thing to look out for anyone that tries to use fomo to get you to buy a position  never never ever buy a position because youre scared of missing out on profits the stock market will always have profitable plays while it exists missing out on one is better than the potential of getting demolished  i know this is basic investing for many of you guys but i also know there are a ton of people here that downloaded robinhood because it was free or their retarded friends gave them an affiliate link and only know how to make a buy and sell order so this is the easiest way to be able to understand what people are talking about in their dd  good luck out there",None,1588973917
MVIS,Some Post DD on MVIS by a newb...Beware,"so as im learning and reading things i came across the sec form defaa that mvis filed now anyone who listened to the earnings call heard the words reverse split thats scary enough as it is but the call wasnt clearest of quality on my end so after reading this new sec filing know this per sec regulation they need their stock to maintain a share  for  consecutive days in order to remain listed mvis is literally calling a vote to reverse split their stock in order to avoid delisting 

now just because a company gets delighted doesnt mean its not profitable that being said their st quarter earnings missed their mark by  

but the patent and buyout with msft 

you can look at this two ways first is that msft sees a dwindling company that they can take advantage of and buy out super cheap to help them avoid being delisted or worse second is the msft wants nothing more than their patented tech with no intention of buying out the company why else would the execs of mvis even discuss a reverse split if msft merger buyout was on the table there would be no point in filing with the sec as they would know they are getting bought 

this second option is my stance and why i am going to be steadfast and not jump back into the mvis bandwagon next week ahead of the shareholders meeeting the choice is yours red pill or blue",Research,1588970479
TOPS,So whats the deal with TOPS?,"looking at their  year chart they managed an impressive feat going from over  per share to worth  per share

APPS,Very detailed DD on APPS. Enjoy!,"apps also known as digital turbine is a company that works at the convergence of media and mobile communications delivering endtoend products and solutions for mobile operators device oems and other third parties to enable them to effectively monetize mobile content 

essentially what digital turbine does is thishttpswwwdigitalturbinecomabout  they makes it easier than ever for people to frictionlessly discover new apps for operators and oems to build new revenue streams and for advertisers to reach users at scale

the past three quarters have proved to show consistently strong numbershttpswwwnasdaqcommarketactivitystocksappsfinancials quarter after quarter and year after year this past earnings call for their most recent quarter was posted back in february on the th their third quarter revenue was  million which is the companys all time high revenue and it shows an  growth when compared to the fiscal third quarter of  

even better they reported a  million growth in their cash balance and they reported zero debt  here is the dd on what i have said in terms to their growth and zero debt reporthttpsirdigitalturbinecompressreleasesdetaildigitalturbinereportsfiscalthirdquarterresults

not only did digital turbine post incredibly positive earnings reporting their all time high revenue they also confirmed an acquisition apps purchased mobile posse for a reported  million this is incredibly well done business for multiple reasons

  they achieved  revenue of  million a gaap net income of  million and a nongaap adjusted ebitda of  million 
 they have reported rapid revenue and profitability growth over the past  years 
 they  have a highly profitable recurring business model with gross margins approaching  and ebitda margins in excess of  
 the acquisition of mobile posse brings digital turbine strategic partners which are tmobile and metro pcs

the best part of everything i have just mentioned is that it will be reflected during their next earnings call which is on june sthttpswwwnasdaqcommarketactivitystocksappsearnings here is all the dd on everything i had just mentioned regarding apps acquisition of mobile possehttpscontentequisolvenetddbcdafbfacdigitalturbinedbpdfmobileposseinvestorsummaryfinalpdf

another thing that has flown under the radar that they have recently done is this on february thhttpsirdigitalturbinecompressreleasesdetaildigitalturbinereportsfiscalthirdquarterresults digital turbine announced their new global distribution with lg electronics this is huge deal for apps itll definitely be reflected upon their next earnings call and all i can see from this distribution partnership is an increase in revenue the distribution partnership plus the acquisition of mobile posse all this will do is increase their revenue by a ton its amazing news but yet both of these have gone under the radar

target prices amp forecasts

 after everything i have just mentioned canaccord genuity  analyst andrew moldow increased digital turbines target pricehttpswwwnasdaqcomarticleswhydigitalturbinestockjumpedwednesday from  to  dollars
 finviz currently sets apps target pricehttpswwwfinvizcomquoteashxtappsamptycamptaamppd to 
 cnn money currently has  analysts offering a price forecastshttpsmoneycnncomquoteforecastforecasthtmlsymbapps for digital turbine inc at a median price target of  with a high estimate of  and a low estimate of 

my final thoughts and comments on this stockcompany

 i personally have invested  into apps i bought  shares a month ago on april nd when i first began hearing about this company
 i have also bought several long calls a month ago that have already been raking in profits for me as well 
 i genuinely do believe that they will reach  by the end of the year i believe so because of all their recent acquisitions and partnerships they have made plus they have zero debt and they reported their highest ever revenue the previous quarter
 they are so close to  dollars which is cnns lowest estimate price target which again adds to why i believe they will reach past the  mark

at the end of the day this is just thorough research on apps what you decide to do whether purchase or not or if you do decide to purchase and you buy a little or a lot thats all on you like i tell everyone please do your own dd as well before you ever hit submit when purchase a stock or an option

please read the articles and links i have clipped into this dd so you can have all the knowledge possible to make a well informed decision

about a month ago this stock was worth around  per share they had a  reverse split in order to bump up the cost per share and avoid delisting from the exchange at the moment the cost per share is fluctuating around 

as far as news goes all i really know is that they reported positive numbers on their last earnings report and apparently theyve been making decent profits on amazon market

im also aware that they have a business contract with lowes which is expected to come into effect in october the contract mentioned something like m tblt branded products supposed to enter lowes ecosystem and theyre also supposed to handle some of lowes own product under the cobalt brand

if you have any other news about this stock or lowes since that would have some effect let everyone know

im planning to hold this stock until mid october and at that point sell it all if theres no positive change",Discussion,1588339765

VISL,My DD on VISL,"visl they are a company known for their array of well produced products in the wireless telecom industry they have work with a vast majority of companies and the military as well 

one of their more recent amp great news that has gone under the radar is the immediate recruitment of jim mcgowan as their vice president amp manager of visl miligov division this man has decades of experience dealing with military contracts and before joining visl he was the vice president of flir systems a company that has a  billion dollar market cap the recruitment of jim mcgowan is going to prove to be very smart business with all the clients he will bring to visl
dd on his recruitmentthttpswwwglobenewswirecomnewsreleaseenvislinktechnologiesappointsjimmcgowanasvicepresidentandgeneralmanagerofitsmilgovbusinessunithtml

their recent contract bids that have been accepted sure you can go ahead and say it is a relatively small contract considering the industry they are in but look at who they are contracted with its a small sheriffs department amp guess who got them the contract in the first place jim mcgowan this shows that despite the covid outbreak this company is still putting in solid work amp after they complete this project with the help of jim mcgowan they will continue getting government and military contracts he just barely joined at the end of march and won them this government contract 
dd on this contracthttpswwwvislinkcomvislinktechnologieswinsaprojecttoreplaceexistinginfrastructuretoournewciraswayallintegratedreceiverandantennasystemforsheriffsdepartment 

their most recent bid was accepted thus beating out all the other competitors as many of you may have heard visl was chosen as the company to provide live high definition amp uninterrupted video board systems for the ferrari race series this is a prestigious contract this shows that they are clearly capable of making solid supplies in order to even accomplish this this shows that if the event coordinators believe in their technology we should too this contract will certainly turn heads when it comes to bidding on more contracts in the future and it goes to show that this company can work in any industry such as sporting events to military contracts
dd on theor most recent contracts contracthttpswwwvislinkcomvislinkchosentoprovidehighdefinitionliveonboardvideosystemsfortheprestigiouseuropeanferrarichallengeraceseries


alongside their most recent contracts if you look their recent history ytd they are all over the world winning government contract bids amp making a name for themselves with most companies reporting loss in profits visl is working hard amp continuously beat their competitors due to the quality of their technology

they will certainly delivery on their next stockholders meeting this meeting will be on may thhttpswwwvislinkcomvislinktechnologiesinctoholdremoteannualmeetingofstockholdersonnewdate

sec filings on  visl filed an k form it only be bad if they were going bankrupt but they are not this form is directly correlated to defaa they filed on  which is the shareholders meeting that will take place next friday may th this goes to show that they are planning to let the shareholders know some big news possibly the amount the contract they signed with the coordinators of the ferrari event or a new contract they are keeping a lid on either way the k filing should be good news next friday khttpssecfilingsnasdaqcomfilingframesetaspfilingidamprcvddateampconamevislinktechnologiesincampformtypekampviewhtml

in the past two weeks on their company website they share news of their current contract acquisitions amp each time they released something positive their value flew up albeit a small change but still its a positive change correlationhttpspasteboardcojgfjaupng

they currently have a target price set at  and with analysts holding a forecast of a high of  i dont believe it will reach  on the next months but i strongly believe it will reach a dollar soon and be over a dollar by the end of the year

at the end of the day its a relatively cheap stock its trading at  cents you can buy  shares right now for  dollars right now i personally bought  shares because if im worng this will drop back down give or take  cents which is where i bought my  shares but if im right then ill make solid profit because its cheap im okay with purchasing  shares

anyy thats my take on visl i personally think its a strong buy amp if tomorrow theres a dip ill buy more

RIGL,The play: $RIGL or Rigel Pharmaceuticals.," rigel pharmaceuticals is a biotech stock that is set to blow 

their primary product a drug called tavalisse treats chronic immune thrombocytopenia a horrible autoimmune disorder rigel is partnered with grifolsgrfs and together theyre releasing tavalisse into europe in a year and once this happens rigel triggers a  million dollar payment from their partner grifols when this drug drops into europe we can expect the  million to help clear up any outstanding debtwhich happens with rampd and they can start clearing more profit from the drug alone and put more money into other ventures

 covid related profit

weve also seen a company this week that is linked to rigel announce a corona virus recovery treatment that is being fast tracked to approval in the ukherehttpwwwpmlivecompharmanewsuksnewcovidtrialinitiativefasttracksbergenbiosbemcentinib bergen bio and their drug bemcentinib was actually developed by rigel and licensed from rigel and earns a  royalty on its uses due to a  agreementherehttpswwwrigelcompipelinepartneredassetsbergenbio what does this mean further profit lower debts and as we all know what happens with any covid news the share prices can moon once the market reflects this data rigel is a relatively small stock which related to the bigger winner here bergen bio but still this will show us positive effects in terms of income and likely news once this conference call occurs on may th tuesday after market close

 who thinks this is worth buying

jp morgan set a price target of  for rigl the price has run up  roughly as of this writing the past week in expectation of positive earnings news and  of the company is owned by institutional investors guys who do this for a living with fmr having  ownership wellington at almost  blackrock with  and vangaurd at  regardless of your price target this company sees promise in the eyes of large institutions and you should see it too

 what should you do

buying and holding shares is one route another route is doing the longest dated calls as theyre very cheap at the moment at the current prices theyre a steal

 tldr

 rigel is accumulating more income in the next year from tavalisse with a europe release a drug it produced and has royalties on is being fast tracked for covid treatments and big investors see potential all of this with a conference call coming up on may th",None,1588256184

UAVS,Why I'm selling my $UAVS shares ASAP this morning,"i started trading a couple months ago i like many others thought pennystocks sounded exciting and like most others i got burned not badly  about a  loss all around but i learned my lesson and i mostly quit and moved on to bigger stocks and lastly now longterm etfindexes 

i bought a few shares of uavs  less than  when it just first started getting traction with some uninvested money i had leftover but im selling this morning heres my thought process

 the market is always forwardthinking 

 the market might be focused right now on the news of them working with an ecommerce company and how it could be amazon  it might be it might not be

 im already up   that is insane but ultimately like any penny stock it isnt magical

 if the market is forwardthinking then imo immediately after the call it will shift to okay but how will they actually implement drone delivery for the company  this is the key in my train of thought 

 i think itll either not be amazon the implementation will be slowrestricted or both which could stall any further growth andor begin the dump 

 im going to make the difficult decision to not be greedy and happily take my  profit and use it towards buying another share of qqq or voo

and who knows maybe im wrong i almost definitely could be i could and may lose on some more profit but im training myself to be happy with good gains for any future penny stocks i dip in and moving on

 news are released frequently
 conclusion ibio is on board to create a possible covid vaccine their fast pharming platform and previous collaborations could increase the stock value in the near term a positive announcement about the covid development may come within three weeks im bullish on the company long term holding until the pandemic is gone might not be a great idea if were looking at their current balance sheet and chart history

 the company is unprofitable for years and the charts history shows multiple reverse splits httpsfinanceyahoocomquoteopgnpopgnamptsrcfinsrch
 lately they are frequently bringing out the news consistency in posting updates and other news on twitter linkedin and facebook
 conclusion opgn sudden spike a while back ago seems to be caused by a pump or dump the company should be able to make more revenue in the period of the pandemic even now i dont expect the company to be profitable theyre a great service for the other pharma companies but the current business model will likely drive them into new reverse splits

idex

 had their business transformation in  as becoming a fintech company httpsideanomicscomaboutuscompanymilestones
 the company had a small amount of revenue in  with negative earnings httpsfinanceyahoocomquoteidexpidexamptsrcfinsrch
 the chart shows a downward direction over time likely to get delisted or another reverse split

 conclusion even though the stock price is around an alltime low the business wont be profitable any time soon might take bankruptcy into account in time of the pandemic or at least more debt many red flags for this company i wont take my shot in this one

 the stock price spiked when the stock went over  httpswwwmarketwatchcominvestingstockssy
 the company is making less revenue than the previous years the yearly earnings are negative they dont have free cash flow httpsfinanceyahoocomquotessycashflowpssy
 no interesting prs or social media
 conclusion the company could benefit from the pandemic if healthcare is in need of new itdevices the emergency fund could benefit ssy i doubt this will happen the stock doesnt rely on the news since there are no interesting prs or social media updates i guess that the stock is going up just because people are judging the chart and hyping each other up

rmti

 biopharma company initial focus is the treatment of anemia in endstage renal disease esrd ie last stage of kidney disease they also provide dialysis and anemia treatment httpswwwrockwellmedcomaboutrockwellmedical
 the company is developed and commercialized its only product dialysate triferic dt currently they had filed a new drug application nda on march   the new product has a different formulation than dt and is called iv triferic they also actively doing researches about new applications for dt httpswwwrockwellmedcombiopharmadevelopment
 dt is a drug that is indicated for iron replacement and hemoglobin in adult hemodialysis patients httpswwwtrifericcom
 rmti produces revenue but yet has negative earnings the value of negative earnings is increasing each year so does the revenue httpsfinanceyahoocomquotermtibalancesheetprmti
 on march   the company agreed to loan m from innovatus to create more flexibility when working towards the advancement of triferic httpsfinanceyahoocomnewsrockwellmedicalincannounceshtml
 conclusion rmti is aiming to become profitable unfortunately this will take a while since the amount of negative earning is only increasing each year the commercialization of triferic and loan agreements are holding the company together i wont be surprised if the stock price is going downwards i also dont expect the stock price to have a sudden rise the fda approval for the second product iv triferic could raise this stock a bit higher no positive change in the quarter earnings after the commercialization of iv triferic will decrease the stock price for sure

 qtrypta is an acute treatment for migraines especially cluster headache httpswwwzosanopharmacompipelinemigraine
 the goal for the fda approval is set for oct   httpsfinanceyahoocomnewszosanopharmaannouncesfdaacceptancehtml
 produces zero revenue but passed the previous three earnings estimation q q and q  httpsfinanceyahoocomquotezsancashflowpzsan
 no frequent news or updates
 conclusion zsan has no short term upcoming news we should look out for probably the hype is caused by fake rumors and people trying to squeeze in the fda approval will take place on oct   this could lead to their best possible spike this year the negative outcome will push the stock price further down might cause a reverse split news about direct public offering or delisting could arise in the near future in my opinion zsan has the potential to grow when the fda approves its first commercial product right now the stock has more chance to decrease in stock price dont jump in or get out if youre already in or hold the bag if you believe in this company

ghsi

 pharma company focused on novel treatments for early detection intervention and monitoring of eye diseases httpsguardionhealthcomabout
 will get delisted if they dont regain  for  consecutive business days by  sept  httpsfinanceyahoocomnewsguardionhealthsciencesgrantedhtml
 nothing mentioned about covid
 the hype is about the new product acummune release which could already be bought at the site of their whollyowned subsidiaries nutriguard httpsstorenutriguardcomsearchqacummuneampadvfalseampcidampiscfalseamppfampptampsidfalse
 initial order form malaysian company to use ghsis proprietary formula the order price is  and the order date is at  june  httpsfinanceyahoocomnewsguardionhealthsciencesreceivesinitialhtml
 ghsis pipeline has  products in its portfolio httpsguardionhealthcomportfolio
 according to yahoo finance theres a growing pattern of revenues last year was k but yet they have small negative earnings httpsfinanceyahoocomquoteghsifinancialspghsi
 do not post frequent news or updates on social media
 conclusion acummune could be that one extra product to finally break the streak of negative earnings for ghsi once they announce the availability of this product the stock will spike how much the news will hit is not certain to me since consumers could already buy this product at the website of nutriguard the whollyowned subsidiaries of ghsi the big spike should be from the quarter earnings of ghsi only if the earnings report a positive income get in and get out after the news in my opinion positive earnings will set the companys support line at a higher worth

ogen

 pharma company focused on oral mucositis a common complication of chemotherapy and developing novel antibiotics against infectious diseases httpswwworagenicscomabout
 oral mucositis isnt treatable currently doctors recommend prevention by brushing or prescribe painkillers and wait till the bacteria which causes the disease dies httpsoralcancerfoundationorgcomplicationsmucositis
 their products og and ag are at the end of the preclinical and phase  respectively httpswwworagenicscomtechnologypipeline
 ogen doesnt participate in the covid hype
 no frequent news updates nor social media
 conclusion ogens products are near the end of their phases the possible good news could pump the stock price up it will definitely be a victim of the pump or dump bad news could dramatically decrease the stock since the company doesnt mention anything about developing a product in relation to covid there could be a massive pump when they unexpectedly report this i highly doubt they will if you expect positive news for both products get in and get out when peaked

 the goal for the fda approval is set for oct   httpsfinanceyahoocomnewszosanopharmaannouncesfdaacceptancehtml
 produces zero revenue but passed the previous three earnings estimation q q and q  httpsfinanceyahoocomquotezsancashflowpzsan
 no frequent news or updates
 conclusion zsan has no short term upcoming news we should look out for probably the hype is caused by fake rumors and people trying to squeeze in the fda approval will take place on oct   this could lead to their best possible spike this year the negative outcome will push the stock price further down might cause a reverse split news about direct public offering or delisting could arise in the near future in my opinion zsan has the potential to grow when the fda approves its first commercial product right now the stock has more chance to decrease in stock price dont jump in or get out if youre already in or hold the bag if you believe in this company

ghsi

 pharma company focused on novel treatments for early detection intervention and monitoring of eye diseases httpsguardionhealthcomabout
 will get delisted if they dont regain  for  consecutive business days by  sept  httpsfinanceyahoocomnewsguardionhealthsciencesgrantedhtml
 nothing mentioned about covid
 the hype is about the new product acummune release which could already be bought at the site of their whollyowned subsidiaries nutriguard httpsstorenutriguardcomsearchqacummuneampadvfalseampcidampiscfalseamppfampptampsidfalse
 initial order form malaysian company to use ghsis proprietary formula the order price is  and the order date is at  june  httpsfinanceyahoocomnewsguardionhealthsciencesreceivesinitialhtml
 ghsis pipeline has  products in its portfolio httpsguardionhealthcomportfolio
 according to yahoo finance theres a growing pattern of revenues last year was k but yet they have small negative earnings httpsfinanceyahoocomquoteghsifinancialspghsi
 do not post frequent news or updates on social media
 conclusion acummune could be that one extra product to finally break the streak of negative earnings for ghsi once they announce the availability of this product the stock will spike how much the news will hit is not certain to me since consumers could already buy this product at the website of nutriguard the whollyowned subsidiaries of ghsi the big spike should be from the quarter earnings of ghsi only if the earnings report a positive income get in and get out after the news in my opinion positive earnings will set the companys support line at a higher worth 

htbx

 pharma company focused on tackling pathogenic or cancer antigens with their proprietary gp platform httpswwwheatbiocomabout
 product hsphase  almost is near its end first product httpswwwheatbiocomproductpipeline
 doing all they can to research for a covid vaccine httpswsvncomnewslocalmiamidadeuniversityofmiamiworkingtodevelopvaccinefbclidiwarbqkuvxuytjitfzrujluohiravevazzlqrztjdqmptnuo
 frequently posting updates and news
 under  stock potential to exceed  mark anytime with the current covid vaccine hype
 been awarded the cprit grant of m to fund a phase clinical trial for their new product ptx httpswwwheatbiocomproductpipelineptx
 raised over m for pipeline development recently httpsfinanceyahoocomnewshtbxmcashadvanceportfoliohtml
 activating tcells to destroy cancer cells is subjected to be a discovery to treat all cancer httpswwwbbccomnewshealth
 massive negative earnings for years compared to their current revenue m vs m
 conclusion htbx has the potential to be profitable looking at their current pipeline the first product hs is at the end of phase ii but i wont expect this to be the case any time soon earnings are looking bad and they still have to go through phase iii now that they put their focus on a covid vaccine more positive news could bring the stock price up pump and dump

ogen

 pharma company focused on oral mucositis a common complication of chemotherapy and developing novel antibiotics against infectious diseases httpswwworagenicscomabout
 oral mucositis isnt treatable currently doctors recommend prevention by brushing or prescribe painkillers and wait till the bacteria which causes the disease dies httpsoralcancerfoundationorgcomplicationsmucositis
 their products og and ag are at the end of the preclinical and phase  respectively httpswwworagenicscomtechnologypipeline
 ogen doesnt participate in the covid hype
 no frequent news updates nor social media
 conclusion ogens products are near the end of their phases the possible good news could pump the stock price up it will definitely be a victim of the pump or dump bad news could dramatically decrease the stock since the company doesnt mention anything about developing a product in relation to covid there could be a massive pump when they unexpectedly report this i highly doubt they will if you expect positive news for both products get in and get out when peaked

akers biosciences and premas biotech announce progress in its vaccine development for covid

globenewswirehttpwwwglobenewswirecomapril  

 successfully obtained clones for all three selected coronavirus antigens  


thorofare new jersey april   globe newswire  akers biosciences inc the company akerhttpsfinanceyahoocomqsaker a developer of rapid health information technologies today announced that its collaboration with premas biotech has successfully completed the milestone of obtaining clones of all three coronavirus antigens spike s envelope e and membrane m that they have selected for their vaccine candidate

the clone development process has four primary steps including first the design and synthesis of the genes second the selection of the right host third the insertion of the gene into the host and fourth the verification that the clone has the right gene and all characteristics are correct

prabuddha kundu cofounder and managing director at premas biotech commented we are pleased with the successful completion of this phase in the development of our novel vaccine candidate we believe that our ability to clone all three of these antigens will differentiate our vaccine candidate from others specifically the surface of a virus is what the immune systems sees and importantly has a multitude of proteins we are providing the immune system with three shots on goal instead of one by including s e and m together this is increasingly important due to the likelihood of protein mutation if a protein mutates a vaccine can be rendered non efficacious a scenario often faced with seasonal flu variations by including three at one time the immune system can still recognize the other two antigens which we believe will enhance its efficacy and assist us in making this vaccine candidate successful

christopher schreiber executive chairman of akers stated we believe that we are one step closer to an effective vaccine candidate for the coronavirus pandemic we have now completed our first important milestone by generating these clones we also have initiated the second stage in protein expression which we hope to provide an update on later this month we are optimistic about the continued success of our partnership with premas one that is already starting to bear fruit

DUST,"All you need to know about JNUG, JDST, NUGT, DUST, and other leveraged ETFs","ive been seeing a lot of confusion lately and i know we have a lot of new traders here so hopefully this is helpful to some of you note that this was getting really long so some of these points arent allinclusive but they should give you a good place to start

 jnug et al is a daily leveraged etf its not a stock
    a stock represents stake in a company if you own shares of a companys stock you own a piece of that company
    an etf is like a basket of stocks andor other assets there can be lots of different assets in the basket and when you own a share of an etf you own a piece of the whole basket kinda like a bundle of fractional shares
       the net value of all the assets in the basket is called the net asset value nav when we talk about nav its usually in the context of how much is one share actually worth vs how much is it being traded for
 the prices of leveraged etfs behave differently from unleveraged normal etfs and stocks
    sometimes you can look at a stock and say it used to be worth  but right now its only  i think the company will recover from the thing that made it drop so ill buy at  and wait for it to get back to  but thats not how daily leveraged etfs work
       the leverage and daily rebalancing that means the leverage gets reset each day makes the math wonky when you hold it for multiple days i could go on and on about this but the point is even if the underlying index of a leveraged etf recovers completely the leveraged etf could still be worth a lot less than it was ie it didnt recover completely
       that doesnt mean there arent gains to be had it just means that you shouldnt base your price targets on historical prices of leveraged etfs unless youre using a model that accounts for the leverage and daily rebalancing
 the price of jnugjdst et al rarely deviates from its nav last year jdsts price was never more than  offset from its nav this year the market has been real volatile and weve seen some days with higher deviation but even this year its rare to see deviations larger than 
    that means roughly that when the price of jnug dips its not because people are bailing out of jnug or panic selling or whatever and when the price jumps its not because people are hyping over jnug its because the underlying index the mvis global junior gold miners index or mvgdxjtr droppedrose
 jnug and jdst are inverse of each other if you think mvgdxjtr ie junior gold mining stocks will go up jump into jnug the x daily bull etf and if you think it will go down jump into jdst the x daily bear etf
    dont hold them both at the same time
 jnugjdst are daily etfs their leverage is accurate to a single day and they arent generally recommended to be held longer than a day 
    multiday holds are sometimes manageable and can be very lucrative but they come with additional risks that you should be aware of
    in particular you should understand the patterns in the underlying index that would cause jnug to rise or fall in addition to how volatility affects the price of jnug
 leveraged etfs are especially volatile their purpose after all is to provide additional leverage on the underlying index
     means if the underlying goes up  then the leveraged etf is supposed to go up  if the underlying goes down  the etf goes down 
 for an unleveraged alternative look at gdxj youll notice the day charts of gdxj and jnug look almost identical but jnug is more exaggerated thats because they follow the same index but jnug is leveraged
    jnug is actually composed usually but this isnt guaranteed of gdxj and derivatives in order to provide  leverage
 this isnt terrible news or anything but jnug and jdst lots of direxion etfs actually are switching from  to  leverage on march  they were going to be switched on may  but that got moved up",None,1585357069

 jnug and jdst are inverse of each other if you think mvgdxjtr ie junior gold mining stocks will go up jump into jnug the x daily bull etf and if you think it will go down jump into jdst the x daily bear etf
    dont hold them both at the same time
 jnugjdst are daily etfs their leverage is accurate to a single day and they arent generally recommended to be held longer than a day 
    multiday holds are sometimes manageable and can be very lucrative but they come with additional risks that you should be aware of
    in particular you should understand the patterns in the underlying index that would cause jnug to rise or fall in addition to how volatility affects the price of jnug
 leveraged etfs are especially volatile their purpose after all is to provide additional leverage on the underlying index
     means if the underlying goes up  then the leveraged etf is supposed to go up  if the underlying goes down  the etf goes down 
 for an unleveraged alternative look at gdxj youll notice the day charts of gdxj and jnug look almost identical but jnug is more exaggerated thats because they follow the same index but jnug is leveraged
    jnug is actually composed usually but this isnt guaranteed of gdxj and derivatives in order to provide  leverage
 this isnt terrible news or anything but jnug and jdst lots of direxion etfs actually are switching from  to  leverage on march  they were going to be switched on may  but that got moved up",None,1585357069
JNUG,"All you need to know about JNUG, JDST, NUGT, DUST, and other leveraged ETFs","ive been seeing a lot of confusion lately and i know we have a lot of new traders here so hopefully this is helpful to some of you note that this was getting really long so some of these points arent allinclusive but they should give you a good place to start

 jnug et al is a daily leveraged etf its not a stock
    a stock represents stake in a company if you own shares of a companys stock you own a piece of that company
    an etf is like a basket of stocks andor other assets there can be lots of different assets in the basket and when you own a share of an etf you own a piece of the whole basket kinda like a bundle of fractional shares
       the net value of all the assets in the basket is called the net asset value nav when we talk about nav its usually in the context of how much is one share actually worth vs how much is it being traded for
 the prices of leveraged etfs behave differently from unleveraged normal etfs and stocks
    sometimes you can look at a stock and say it used to be worth  but right now its only  i think the company will recover from the thing that made it drop so ill buy at  and wait for it to get back to  but thats not how daily leveraged etfs work
       the leverage and daily rebalancing that means the leverage gets reset each day makes the math wonky when you hold it for multiple days i could go on and on about this but the point is even if the underlying index of a leveraged etf recovers completely the leveraged etf could still be worth a lot less than it was ie it didnt recover completely
       that doesnt mean there arent gains to be had it just means that you shouldnt base your price targets on historical prices of leveraged etfs unless youre using a model that accounts for the leverage and daily rebalancing

 this is an etf which means the price of jnug tracks something else its not a typical stock however as it falls stop losses are being triggered and orders being filled people are scooping up these cheaper shares at much lower prices jnug also tracks gdxj so its possible its fallen as low as it will but i highly doubt it jnug is already down  today which i think is more than yesterday  is the next big wall after each wall is broken there is some pullback and then what i believe will be continuous dips throughout the day unless the stimulus bill is signed
 should you hold into the weekend imo heck no run as fast as you can from that decision  this is not a hold into the weekend this is a leveraged etf and even dixerion says its super volatile while we may see  or  or whatever people want to throw out as a high number whats most important is people take their profits where they want and dont get greedy in reality imo jnug will have a huge drop off eod right before close because people wont want to hold over the weekend and then and only then will jdst holders touch the moon that is an opinion backed by last fridays chart which saw jnug dip an hour before close and then rocket to 
 where do i think itll close this is just a guess but i think it definitely breaks  and closes somewhere around  and if it rockets into oblivion  just my predictions and opinions

AGRX,Why you should invest in $AGRX now:,"agile therapeutics agrx is a pharmaceutical company and has one product twirla it was fda approved in mid february  unfortunately stock price has gone down due to stock dilutions and the cv outbreak along with the fact that the fda approval was baked into the stock price 

on stocktwits user supermarioo wrote

 okay since i heard someone mention bo ill share my thoughts again i know posters on other beaten down stocks scream amp hope for bo out of desperation but a few minutes of research and you notice  insider selling or product was piii approved but still needs years and  to submit nda amp receive fda approval agrx is diff and is a prime buyout target min of  in march or april is my guess   

 agile has expertise in developing products  not sales amp marketing 

 fda approved product with big market share potential 

 big pharma already have sales amp marketing teams doctor connections etc and can launch twirla much sooner 

 cheaper for big pharma to buy an fda approved product instead of developing one that may take  years  

 cfo recently hired has sold last  prior companies 

 ceo also has a history of selling companies 

 insider buying  quite a bit last  weeks 

 big cash position for negotiation leverage the timing of the cash raise suspect amp had a bo taste 

and also wrote

 a bad market is good timing for an acquisition you are a penny flipper amp cant see beyond tomorrow ofcourse they can sell the product  its free with affordable care act and the chc market is growing yoy big pharmas growth strategy is mampas not holding onto cash

analyst forecasts range from    as long as you hold tight onto this stock you should eventually make a profit if a bo happens

background on the second one partnership was formed between genius brands and the alibaba company of china  alibaba chinas largest company  will coproduce stan lees superhero kindergarten with us starring arnold schwarzenegger as well as distribute promote and oversee licensing of consumer products and merchandising in china

to add to that they just announced that one of their core shows rainbow rangers had the amount of airings per week increased to  by nickelodeon
